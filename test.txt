The NASA STI Program…in Profile
Since its founding, NASA has been dedicated to the
advancement of aeronautics and space science. The
NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI)
Program Office plays a key part in helping NASA
maintain this important role.
The NASA STI Program Office is operated by
Langley Research Center, the lead center for
NASA’s scientific and technical information. The
NASA STI Program Office provides access to
the NASA STI Database, the largest collection of
aeronautical and space science STI in the world.
The Program Office is also NASA’s institutional
mechanism for disseminating the results of its
research and development activities. These results
are published by NASA in the NASA STI Report
Series, which includes the following report types:
• TECHNICAL PUBLICATION. Reports of
completed research or a major significant
phase of research that present the results of
NASA programs and include extensive data
or theoretical analysis. Includes compilations
of significant scientific and technical data
and information deemed to be of continuing
reference value. NASA’s counterpart of peerreviewed formal professional papers but has less
stringent limitations on manuscript length and
extent of graphic presentations.
• TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM. Scientific
and technical findings that are preliminary or of
specialized interest, e.g., quick release reports,
working papers, and bibliographies that contain
minimal annotation. Does not contain extensive
analysis.
• CONTRACTOR REPORT. Scientific and
technical findings by NASA-sponsored
contractors and grantees.

• CONFERENCE PUBLICATION. Collected
papers from scientific and technical conferences,
symposia, seminars, or other meetings sponsored
or cosponsored by NASA.
• SPECIAL PUBLICATION. Scientific, technical,
or historical information from NASA programs,
projects, and mission, often concerned with
subjects having substantial public interest.
• TECHNICAL TRANSLATION.
English-language translations of foreign
scientific and technical material pertinent to
NASA’s mission.
Specialized services that complement the STI
Program Office’s diverse offerings include creating
custom thesauri, building customized databases,
organizing and publishing research results…even
providing videos.
