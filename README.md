# Fluid Network Solver

> **🚧 BETA - WORK IN PROGRESS**
> 
> This software is under active development. While physics equations are validated against published references, the application has not been verified against physical test data or commercial software outputs. **Do not use for safety-critical decisions without independent verification.**

A web-based fluid network solver supporting both incompressible (liquid) and compressible (gas) flows, with automatic detection of choked flow conditions.

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

**This software is intended for engineering analysis and educational purposes.**

Before using results for safety-critical applications:

1. **Verify assumptions** - The solver uses idealized models (see Assumptions section)
2. **Cross-check results** - Compare with manual calculations or other tools
3. **Apply safety factors** - Engineering practice requires appropriate margins
4. **Review by qualified engineer** - Critical systems require professional review

The solver includes 98 unit tests validating all physics equations against published data (Crane TP-410, NIST, Perry's Handbook, NASA GFSSP). Run `npm test` to verify.

## Features

---

## Theoretical Background

### 1. Incompressible (Liquid) Flow

#### 1.1 Pipe Friction - Darcy-Weisbach Equation

The pressure drop due to friction in a pipe:

$$\Delta P_f = f \frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho V^2}{2}$$

Where:
- $f$ = Darcy friction factor (dimensionless)
- $L$ = pipe length (m)
- $D$ = pipe diameter (m)
- $\rho$ = fluid density (kg/m³)
- $V$ = flow velocity (m/s)

#### 1.2 Friction Factor - Swamee-Jain Approximation

For turbulent flow ($Re > 2300$), the friction factor is calculated using the Swamee-Jain explicit approximation of the Colebrook-White equation:

$$f = \frac{0.25}{\left[\log_{10}\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{3.7D} + \frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}}\right)\right]^2}$$

For laminar flow ($Re < 2300$):

$$f = \frac{64}{Re}$$

Where:
- $\varepsilon$ = pipe roughness (m)
- $Re$ = Reynolds number = $\frac{\rho V D}{\mu}$
- $\mu$ = dynamic viscosity (Pa·s)

#### 1.3 Flow Through Restrictions (Unchoked)

For flow through a valve or orifice with discharge coefficient $C_d$ and flow area $A$:

$$Q = C_d \cdot A \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta P}{\rho}}$$

Or in terms of mass flow rate:

$$\dot{m} = C_d \cdot A \cdot \sqrt{2 \rho \Delta P}$$

This can be rearranged to the resistance form:

$$\Delta P = R \cdot Q \cdot |Q|$$

Where the resistance:

$$R = \frac{\rho}{2 (C_d \cdot A)^2}$$

#### 1.4 Choked Liquid Flow (Cavitation)

When the downstream pressure $P_2$ drops below the fluid's vapor pressure $P_v$, cavitation occurs and flow becomes **choked**. The flow rate becomes independent of downstream pressure:

$$\dot{m}_{choked} = C_d \cdot A \cdot \sqrt{2 \rho (P_1 - P_v)}$$

**Choke condition:** $P_2 \leq P_v$

---

### 2. Compressible (Gas) Flow

#### 2.1 Critical Pressure Ratio

For isentropic flow of a compressible gas, the critical pressure ratio at which flow becomes sonic (choked) is:

$$\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)_{critical} = \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}}$$

Where $\gamma = C_p / C_v$ is the specific heat ratio.

| Gas | γ | Critical Ratio |
|-----|---|----------------|
| Air, N₂, O₂ | 1.40 | 0.528 |
| CO₂ | 1.30 | 0.546 |
| CH₄ | 1.32 | 0.540 |
| He, Ar | 1.67 | 0.487 |
| Steam | 1.33 | 0.540 |

#### 2.2 Unchoked (Subsonic) Gas Flow

For subsonic flow where $(P_2/P_1) > (P_2/P_1)_{critical}$:

$$\dot{m} = C_d \cdot A \cdot \sqrt{2 \rho_1 P_1 \cdot \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \cdot \left[\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{2/\gamma} - \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{(\gamma+1)/\gamma}\right]}$$

#### 2.3 Choked (Sonic) Gas Flow

When $(P_2/P_1) \leq (P_2/P_1)_{critical}$, flow velocity at the restriction reaches the speed of sound and mass flow becomes independent of downstream pressure:

$$\dot{m}_{choked} = C_d \cdot A \cdot \sqrt{\gamma \rho_1 P_1} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2(\gamma - 1)}}$$

The choked flow coefficient:

$$C^* = \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2(\gamma - 1)}}$$

| γ | C* |
|---|-----|
| 1.40 | 0.685 |
| 1.30 | 0.667 |
| 1.67 | 0.728 |

#### 2.4 Isentropic Expansion (Temperature Change)

**CRITICAL: For compressible (gas) flow, temperature changes as pressure changes.**

When gas flows through a pipe system and pressure drops, the temperature also drops. This is isentropic (reversible, adiabatic) expansion - the same physics that makes a spray can get cold when you use it.

**The relationship:**

$$\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}$$

Or equivalently:

$$T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}$$

Where:
- $T_1, T_2$ = upstream and downstream temperatures (K)
- $P_1, P_2$ = upstream and downstream pressures (Pa)
- $\gamma$ = specific heat ratio ($C_p/C_v$)

**Example: Air expanding from 3 bar to 1 bar**
- $\gamma = 1.4$ for air
- Exponent = $(1.4 - 1)/1.4 = 0.286$
- If $T_1 = 350$ K (77°C), then:
- $T_2 = 350 \times (1/3)^{0.286} = 350 \times 0.684 = 239$ K (-34°C)

**Temperature drop = 111°C!** This is why accounting for local temperature is critical.

#### 2.5 Local Fluid Properties

The solver tracks pressure AND temperature at each node in the network. Local fluid properties are calculated using:

**Ideal Gas Law (density):**

$$\rho = \frac{PM}{RT}$$

Where:
- $P$ = local pressure (Pa)
- $M$ = molecular weight (kg/mol)
- $R$ = universal gas constant = 8.314 J/(mol·K)
- $T$ = local temperature (K)

**Sutherland's Law (viscosity):**

$$\mu = \mu_{ref} \cdot \left(\frac{T}{T_{ref}}\right)^{1.5} \cdot \frac{T_{ref} + S}{T + S}$$

Where:
- $\mu_{ref}$ = reference viscosity at $T_{ref}$
- $S$ = Sutherland constant (K), specific to each gas

| Gas | S (K) | $\mu_{ref}$ at 20°C (Pa·s) |
|-----|-------|---------------------------|
| Air | 110.4 | 1.82×10⁻⁵ |
| N₂ | 111 | 1.76×10⁻⁵ |
| O₂ | 127 | 2.03×10⁻⁵ |
| He | 79.4 | 1.96×10⁻⁵ |
| H₂ | 72 | 0.88×10⁻⁵ |
| CO₂ | 240 | 1.47×10⁻⁵ |

### 3. Valve Specification Methods

The solver supports four methods to specify valve characteristics:

#### 3.1 Discharge Coefficient + Diameter ($C_d$ & $D$)

Specify $C_d$ (dimensionless) and valve diameter $D_{valve}$ (with units).

Flow area calculated as:
$$A = \frac{\pi D_{valve}^2}{4}$$

#### 3.2 Discharge Coefficient + Area ($C_d$ & $A$)

Specify $C_d$ (dimensionless) and flow area $A$ directly (with units).

#### 3.3 Effective Area ($C_d \times A$)

Specify the product $C_d \cdot A$ directly (units of area, m²).

This is the most direct specification for valve performance.

#### 3.4 Flow Coefficient ($C_v$)

The flow coefficient $C_v$ is defined as the flow rate of water in US GPM at 1 psi pressure drop:

$$Q_{GPM} = C_v \sqrt{\frac{\Delta P_{psi}}{SG}}$$

Where $SG$ is specific gravity (relative to water).

**Converting to SI:**

$$Q_{m^3/s} = C_v \cdot 7.599 \times 10^{-7} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\Delta P_{Pa}}{SG}}$$

**Relationship between $C_v$ and $C_d \cdot A$:**

$$C_d \cdot A \approx C_v \cdot 2.6 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2$$

### 4. Typical Discharge Coefficients

| Component | $C_d$ |
|-----------|-------|
| Sharp-edged orifice | 0.60 - 0.65 |
| Rounded entry (r/d > 0.15) | 0.97 - 0.99 |
| ASME flow nozzle | 0.95 - 0.99 |
| Venturi tube | 0.98 - 0.99 |
| Gate valve (open) | 0.93 - 0.97 |
| Ball valve (open) | 0.95 - 0.98 |
| Globe valve (open) | 0.50 - 0.60 |
| Butterfly valve (open) | 0.70 - 0.80 |

---

### 5. Orifice Flow

For an orifice plate with diameter ratio $\beta = d_{orifice} / D_{pipe}$:

The loss coefficient:

$$K = \frac{1 - \beta^4}{C_d^2 \cdot \beta^4}$$

And the pressure drop:

$$\Delta P = K \cdot \frac{\rho V^2}{2}$$

---

### 6. Network Solution Method

The solver uses an iterative Newton-Raphson method based on mass conservation:

1. **Initialize** pressures at internal nodes (average of boundary pressures)
2. **For each iteration:**
   - Calculate flow rates in each pipe: $Q = \text{sign}(\Delta P) \cdot \sqrt{|\Delta P| / R}$
   - Check for choked flow conditions and adjust
   - For each internal node, compute mass imbalance: $\sum Q_{in} - \sum Q_{out}$
   - Apply pressure corrections using Newton-Raphson
3. **Converge** when mass imbalance < tolerance ($10^{-6}$)

For choked flow conditions:
- Flow is calculated using choked flow equations
- Downstream pressure no longer affects flow rate
- Solver adjusts upstream pressures accordingly

### 10. Assumptions and Limitations

**The solver makes the following assumptions:**

| Assumption | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **Steady-state flow** | No transient effects (water hammer, startup) |
| **One-dimensional flow** | No cross-sectional variations |
| **Ideal gas behavior** | Accurate for gases at moderate pressures (<20 bar) |
| **Isentropic expansion** | Adiabatic, reversible process (no heat transfer, friction heating) |
| **Incompressible liquids** | Liquid density constant with pressure |
| **Single-phase flow** | No two-phase (liquid-gas) mixtures |
| **Fully developed flow** | Entrance effects neglected |
| **No heat transfer** | Adiabatic pipe walls |

**When these assumptions may not hold:**

- **High pressures (>20 bar)**: Real gas effects may be significant
- **Near saturation**: Liquid may flash to vapor, gas may condense
- **Long pipes with heat transfer**: Temperature changes from environment
- **Rapid transients**: Water hammer, pressure surges
- **Two-phase flow**: Flashing, condensation, or mixed flow

**Recommended verification:**

1. Compare with known analytical solutions for simple cases
2. Verify mass conservation (inlet flow = outlet flow)
3. Check that pressures are physically reasonable
4. For critical applications, use established commercial software

#### GFSSP Comparison (NASA/TP-2016-218218)

| Feature | GFSSP Reference | FluidSolver | Match |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Choked flow behavior | Example 3 (nozzle) | Same flow rate regardless of P₂ below critical | ✅ Yes |
| Choked mass flow formula | Eq. 3.x | ṁ = Cd×A×P₁×√(γM/RT)×(2/(γ+1))^((γ+1)/(2(γ-1))) | ✅ Exact |
