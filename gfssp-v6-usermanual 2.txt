        The motivation to develop a general purpose computer program to compute pressure and
flow distribution in a complex fluid network came from the need to calculate the axial load on the
bearings in a turbopump. During the early years of space shuttle main engine development, several
specific purpose codes were developed to model the turbopumps. However, it was difficult to use
those codes for a new design without making extensive changes in the original code. Such efforts
often turn out to be time consuming and inefficient. To satisfy the need to model these turbopumps
in an efficient and timely manner, development of the Generalized Fluid System Simulation Pro-
gram (GFSSP) was started at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in March 1994. The objective
was to develop a general fluid flow system solver capable of handling phase change, compressibil-
ity, and mixture thermodynamics. Emphasis was given to construct a user-friendly program using
a modular structured code. The intent of this effort was that an engineer with an undergraduate
background in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics should be able to rapidly develop a reliable
model. The interest in modular code development was intended to facilitate future modifications
to the program.

        The code development was carried out in several phases. At the end of each phase a workshop
was held where the latest version of the code was released to MSFC engineers for testing, verification,
and feedback. The steady state version of GFSSP (version 1.4) was first released in October 1996.
This version is also commercially available through the Open Channel Foundation. The unsteady
version was released in October 1997 (version 2.0). A graphical user interface (GUI) for GFSSP was
developed and was part of version 3.0 which was released in November 1999. GFSSP (version 3.0)
won the NASA Software of the Year award in 2001. Fluid transient (water hammer) capability was
added in version 4.0 that was released in March 2003. Conjugate heat transfer capability was added
in version 5.0 which was released in February 2007. The main highlights of the present version (ver-
sion 6.0) are: (1) extension of mixture option to handle phase change, (2) multiple pressure and flow
regulators in a flow circuit, (3) fixed flow rate and the International System of Units option, (4) two-
dimensional flow modeling within a flow network system, and (5) extension of user-specified fluid
property table to handle phase change.

       This Technical Publication provides a detailed discussion of the data structure, mathematical
formulation, computer program, GUI, and includes a number of example problems. Section 1 pro-
vides an introduction and overview of the code. Data structure of the code is described in section 2.
The mathematical formulation that includes the description of governing equations and the solution
procedure for solving the equations is described in section 3. The program structure is discussed in
section 4. Section 5 describes GFSSP’s GUI, which is called visual thermofluid dynamic analyzer for
systems and components (VTASC). Several example problems are described in section 6. The new
user may skip sections 2 through 4 initially, but will benefit from these sections after gaining some
experience with the code.

       The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a general purpose computer
program for analyzing steady state and time-dependent flow rates, pressures, temperatures, and
concentrations in a complex flow network. The program is capable of modeling real fluids with
phase changes, compressibility, mixture thermodynamics, conjugate heat transfer between solid
and fluid, fluid transients, pumps, compressors, and external body forces such as gravity and cen-
trifugal. The thermofluid system to be analyzed is discretized into nodes, branches, and conduc-
tors. The scalar properties such as pressure, temperature, and concentrations are calculated at nodes.
Mass flow rates and heat transfer rates are computed in branches and conductors. The graphical user
interface allows users to build their models using the ‘point, drag, and click’ method; the users can
also run their models and post-process the results in the same environment.

       Two thermodynamic property programs (GASP/WASP and GASPAK) provide required
thermodynamic and thermophysical properties for 36 fluids: helium, methane, neon, nitrogen,
carbon monoxide, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, fluorine, hydrogen, parahydrogen, water, kerosene
(RP-1), isobutene, butane, deuterium, ethane, ethylene, hydrogen sulfide, krypton, propane, xenon,
R-11, R-12, R-22, R-32, R-123, R-124, R-125, R-134A, R-152A, nitrogen trifluoride, ammonia,
hydrogen peroxide, and air. The program also provides the options of using any incompressible fluid
with constant density and viscosity or ideal gas. The users can also supply property tables for fluids
that are not in the library.

        Twenty-four different resistance/source options are provided for modeling momentum sources
or sinks in the branches. These options include pipe flow, flow through a restriction, noncircular duct,
pipe flow with entrance and/or exit losses, thin sharp orifice, thick orifice, square edge reduction,
square edge expansion, rotating annular duct, rotating radial duct, labyrinth seal, parallel plates,
common fittings and valves, pump characteristics, pump power, valve with a given loss coefficient,
Joule-Thompson device, control valve, heat exchanger core, parallel tube, and compressible orifice.
The program has the provision of including additional resistance options through User Subroutines.

        GFSSP employs a finite volume formulation of mass, momentum, and energy conserva-
tion equations in conjunction with the thermodynamic equations of state for real fluids as well as
energy conservation equations for the solid. The system of equations describing the fluid network
is solved by a hybrid numerical method that is a combination of the Newton-Raphson and successive
substitution methods. The application and verification of the code has been demonstrated through
30 example problems.

         GENERALIZED FLUID SYSTEM SIMULATION PROGRAM, VERSION 6.0


                                        1. INTRODUCTION


        The need for a generalized computer program for thermofluid analysis in a flow network has
been felt for a long time in aerospace industries. Designers of thermofluid systems often need to
know pressures, temperatures, flow rates, concentrations, and heat transfer rates at different parts of
a flow circuit for steady state or transient conditions. Such applications occur in propulsion systems
for tank pressurization, internal flow analysis of rocket engine turbopumps, chilldown of cryogenic
tanks and transfer lines, and many other applications of gas-liquid systems involving fluid transients
and conjugate heat and mass transfer. Computer resource requirements to perform time-dependent,
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of such systems are
prohibitive and therefore are not practical. A possible recourse is to construct a fluid network con-
sisting of a group of flow branches such as pipes and ducts that are joined together at a number of
nodes. They can range from simple systems consisting of a few nodes and branches to very complex
networks containing many flow branches simulating valves, orifices, bends, pumps, and turbines.
In the analysis of existing or proposed networks, node pressures, temperatures, and concentrations
at the system boundaries are usually known. The problem is to determine all internal nodal pres-
sures, temperatures, concentrations, and branch flow rates. Such schemes are known as network flow
analysis methods and they use largely empirical information to model fluid friction and heat transfer.
For example, an accurate prediction of axial thrust in a liquid rocket engine turbopump requires
the modeling of fluid flow in a very complex network. Such a network involves the flow of cryo-
genic fluid through extremely narrow passages, flow between rotating and stationary surfaces, phase
changes, mixing of fluids, and heat transfer. Propellant feed system designers are often required to
analyze pressurization or blowdown processes in flow circuits consisting of many series and paral-
lel flow branches containing various pipe fittings and valves using cryogenic fluids. The designers of
a fluid system are also required to know the maximum pressure in the pipe line after a sudden valve
closure or opening.

        Available commercial codes are generally suitable for steady state, single-phase incompress-
ible flow. Because of the proprietary nature of such codes, it is not possible to extend their capability
to satisfy the above-mentioned needs. In the past, specific purpose codes were developed to model
the space shuttle main engine turbopump. However, it was difficult to use those codes for a new
design without making extensive changes in the original code. Such efforts often turn out to be time
consuming and inefficient. Therefore, the Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP)1
has been developed at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) as a general fluid flow system
solver capable of handling phase changes, compressibility, mixture thermodynamics, and transient



                                                                                                       1

operations. It also includes the capability to model external body forces such as gravity and centrifu-
gal effects in a complex flow network. The objective of the present effort is to (a) develop a robust
and efficient numerical algorithm to solve a system of equations describing a flow network contain-
ing phase changes, mixing, and rotation, and (b) to implement the algorithm in a structured, easy-
to-use computer program.

        This program requires that the flow network be resolved into nodes and branches. The pro-
gram’s preprocessor allows the user to interactively develop a fluid network simulation consisting of
fluid nodes and branches, solid nodes, and conductors. In each branch, the momentum equation is
solved to obtain the flow rate in that branch. At each fluid node, the conservation of mass, energy,
and species equations are solved to obtain the pressures, temperatures, and species concentrations at
that node. At each solid node, the energy conservation equation is solved to calculate temperature of
the solid.

        This Technical Publication (TP) documents the data structure, mathematical formulation,
computer program, and graphical user interface (GUI). Use of the code is illustrated by 30 example
problems. It also documents the verification and validation effort conducted by code developers and
users. This section also presents an overview of the subsequent sections to provide users with a global
perspective of the code.

                                1.1 Network Flow Analysis Methods

         The oldest method for systematically solving a problem consisting of steady flow in a pipe
network is the Hardy Cross method.2 Not only is this method suited for hand calculations, but it has
also been widely employed for use in computer-generated solutions. But as computers allowed much
larger networks to be analyzed, it became apparent that the convergence of the Hardy Cross method
might be very slow or even fail to provide a solution in some cases. The main reason for this numeri-
cal difficulty is that the Hardy Cross method does not solve the system of equations simultaneously.
It considers a portion of the flow network to determine the continuity and momentum errors. The
head loss and the flow rates are corrected and then it proceeds to an adjacent portion of the cir-
cuit. This process is continued until the whole circuit is completed. This sequence of operations is
repeated until the continuity and momentum errors are minimized. It is evident that the Hardy Cross
method belongs in the category of successive substitution methods and it is likely that it may encoun-
ter convergence difficulties for large circuits. In later years, the Newton-Raphson method has been
utilized3 to solve large networks. The Newton-Raphson method solves all the governing equations
simultaneously and is numerically more stable and reliable than successive substitution methods.

        The network analysis method4 has been widely used in thermal analysis codes (SINDA/G5
and SINDA/FLUINT6) using an electric analog. The partial differential equation of heat conduc-
tion is discretized into finite difference form expressing temperature of a node in terms of tempera-
tures of neighboring nodes and ambient nodes. The set of finite difference equations is solved to
calculate temperature of the solid nodes and heat fluxes between the nodes. There have been some
limited applications of thermal network analysis methods to model fluid flows. Such attempts did
not go far because of the inability of heat conduction equations to handle the nonlinear fluid iner-
tia term. There has been limited success in modeling compressible and two-phase flows by such
methods.

       At MSFC, another system analysis code, ROCETS7 is routinely used for simulating flow in
rocket engines. ROCETS has a very flexible architecture where users develop the system model by
integrating component modules such as pumps, turbines, and valves. The user can also build any
model of specific components to integrate into the system model. ROCETS solves the system of
equations by a modified Newton-Raphson method.8

       The finite volume method (FVM) has been widely used in solving Navier-Stokes equations in
CFD.9 The FVM divides the flow domain into a discrete number of control volumes and determines
the conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species for each control volume. Simul-
taneous solutions of these conservation equations provide the pressure, velocity components, tem-
perature, and concentrations representative of the discrete control volumes. The numerical method
is called ‘pressure based’ if the pressures are calculated from the mass conservation equation and
density from the equation of state. On the other hand, a ‘density based’ numerical method uses the
mass conservation equation to calculate density of the fluid and pressure from the equation of state.
GFSSP uses a pressure-based FVM as the foundation of its numerical scheme.

1.1.1 Network Definitions

        GFSSP constructs a fluid network using fluid and solid nodes. The fluid circuit is constructed
with boundary nodes, internal nodes, and branches (fig. 1) while the solid circuit is constructed with
solid nodes, ambient nodes, and conductors. The solid and fluid nodes are connected with solid-fluid
conductors. Users must specify conditions such as pressure, temperature, and concentration of spe-
cies at the boundary nodes. These variables are calculated at the internal nodes by solving conser-
vation equations of mass, energy, and species in conjunction with the thermodynamic equation of
state. Each internal node is a control volume where there is inflow and outflow of mass, energy, and
species at the boundaries of the control volume. The internal node also has resident mass, energy,
and concentration. The momentum conservation equation is expressed in flow rates and is solved
in branches. At the solid node, the energy conservation equation for solid is solved to compute tem-
perature of the solid node. Figure 1 shows a schematic and GFSSP flow circuit of a counter flow heat
exchanger. Hot nitrogen gas is flowing through a pipe, colder nitrogen is flowing counter to the hot
stream in the annulus pipe, and heat transfer occurs through metal tubes. The problem considered is
to calculate flow rates and temperature distributions in both streams.

                                   1.2 Units and Sign Conventions

       GFSSP uses British gravitational units (commonly known as engineering units). Table 1
describes the units of variables used in the code. The units in the second column are the units that
appear in the input and output data files. Users must specify the values in these units in their model.
The units that are listed in the third column are internal to the code and used during the solution
of the equations. These units must be used in user-provided subroutines. The user has the option of
entering the International System of Units (SI) into the preprocessor; these will be converted to engi-
neering units when written to the input file (see sec. 5.1.3). GFSSP uses standard sign conventions
for mass and heat transfer. Mass and heat input to a node is considered positive. Similarly mass and
heat output from a node is considered negative.

                                                    1.3 Data Structure

        GFSSP has a unique data structure (fig. 2) that allows constructing all possible arrangements
of a flow network with no limit on the number of elements. The elements of a flow network are
boundary nodes, internal nodes, and branches. For conjugate heat transfer problems, there are three
additional elements: solid node, ambient node, and conductor. The relationship between a fluid node
and a branch as well as a solid node and conductor is defined by a set of relational geometric proper-
ties. For example, the relational geometric properties of a node are number and name of branches
connected to it. With the help of these properties, it is possible to define any structure of the network
as it progresses through every junction of the network. The positive or negative flow direction is also
defined locally. Unlike a structured coordinate system, there is no global definition of flow direction
and origin. The development of a flow network can start from any point and can proceed in any
direction.

        All elements of a network have properties. The properties can be classified into two catego-
ries: geometric and thermofluid. Geometric properties are again classified into two subcategories:
relational and quantitative. Relational properties define the relationship of the element with the
neighboring elements. Quantitative properties include geometric parameters such as area, length,
and volume. GFSSP’s data structure is discussed in detail in section 2.

                                        1.4 Mathematical Formulation

          GFSSP solves the conservation equations of mass and momentum in internal nodes and
 branches to calculate fluid properties. It also solves for energy conservation equations to calculate
  temperatures of solid nodes. Table 2 shows the mathematical closure that describes the unknown
 variables and the available equations to solve the variables. Pressure, temperature, species concen-
tration, and resident mass in a control volume are calculated at the internal nodes, whereas the flow

rate is calculated at the branch. The equations are coupled and nonlinear; therefore, they are solved
by an iterative numerical scheme. GFSSP employs a unique numerical scheme known as simultane-
ous adjustment with successive substitution (SASS), which is a combination of Newton-Raphson
and successive substitution methods. The coupling of equations is shown in figure 3. The mass and
momentum conservation equations and the equation of state are solved by the Newton-Raphson
method while the conservation of energy and species are solved by the successive substitution method.

        The total number of equations to be solved is determined from the number of internal nodes
and branches. Figure 4 shows a typical interpropellant flow circuit in a rocket engine turbopump. In
this circuit there are five boundary nodes and seven internal nodes. These nodes are connected by
12 branches. There are three inlet boundary nodes (48, 66, and 22) where oxygen, helium, and hydro-
gen enter into the fluid circuit. Mixtures of helium-hydrogen and helium-oxygen exit the circuit-
through boundary nodes numbered 50 and 16, respectively. At each internal node, four equations

                                                                                   The concentration of
the third component is determined from the fact that the sum of all concentrations must be unity.
Flow rates are calculated in 12 branches. Therefore, GFSSP solves for 40 (= 7 × 4 + 12) equations to
calculate all required variables in the circuit. Since the example problem is at steady state, resident
mass in the control volume was not calculated. The transient model of the same fluid circuit would
require the solution of 47 (= 7 × 5 + 12) equations at each time step of the simulation. The mathemati-
cal formulation has been described in detail in section 3.

                                                       1.5 Fluid Properties

        GFSSP is linked with two thermodynamic property programs, GASP10 and WASP11 and
GASPAK,12 that provide thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of selected fluids. Both
programs cover a range of pressure and temperature that allows fluid properties to be evaluated
for liquid, liquid-vapor (saturation), and vapor region. GASP and WASP provide properties of
12 fluids (table 3). GASPAK includes a library of 35 fluids (table 4).

                                          1.6 Flow Resistances

        In network flow analysis code, flow resistances are modeled by empirical laws. These empiri-
cal laws have been incorporated to model flow resistances for pipe flow, orifices, valves, and various
pipe fittings. GFSSP models these flow resistances in the momentum conservation equation as a fric-
tion term. There are 24 different resistance options available to users to choose from. There is also
a provision for introducing a new resistance option through User Subroutines. The available resis-
tance options are shown in table 5.

        GFSSP has three major parts (fig. 5). The first part is the GUI, visual thermofluid analyzer
of systems and components (VTASC). VTASC allows users to create a flow circuit by a ‘point and
click’ paradigm. It creates the GFSSP input file after the completion of the model building process.

                                                                            Solver and

It can also create a customized GFSSP executable by compiling and linking User Subroutines with
the solver module of the code. Users can run GFSSP from VTASC and post-process the results in
the same environment. The second major part of the program is the solver and property module.
This is the heart of the program that reads the input data file, and generates the required conservation

                                                                                                                                                                  9

equations for all internal nodes and branches with the help of thermodynamic property data. It also
interfaces with User Subroutines to receive any specific inputs from users. Finally, output files are
created for VTASC to read and display results. The User Subroutine is the third major part of the
program. This consists of several blank subroutines that are called by the Solver Module. These sub-
routines allow the users to incorporate any new physical model, resistance option, fluid, etc. in the
model. The computer program is discussed in detail in section 4.

                                     1.8 Graphical User Interface

        GFSSP’s GUI (fig. 6) provides the users a platform to build and run their models. It also allows
post-processing of results. The network flow circuit is first built using three basic elements: bound-
ary node, internal node, and branch. Then the properties of the individual elements are assigned.
Users are also required to define global options of the model that includes input/output files, fluid
specification, and any special options such as rotation, heat exchanger, etc. During execution of the
program, a run manager window opens up and users can monitor the progress of the numerical solu-
tion. On the completion of the run, it allows users to visualize the results in tabular form for steady
state solutions and in graphical form for unsteady solutions. It also provides an interface to activate
and import data to the plotting program, Winplot,13 for post-processing. The GUI is discussed in
detail in section 5.




           Figure 6. GFSSP’s graphical user interface, VTASC, allows creating, running,
                     and viewing results in one environment.

                                           2. DATA STRUCTURE


        Conventional CFD codes generally use a structured coordinate system to express conserva-
tion equations for mass, momentum, and energy. The examples of structured coordinate systems
are rectangular cartesian, cylindrical polar, and spherical polar. In these coordinate systems, each
control volume has a fixed number of neighboring control volumes with which it exchanges mass,
momentum, and energy. In one dimension, each control volume has two neighbors; in two and three
dimensions, it has four and six neighbors, respectively. However, in network flow analysis, a control
volume can have an arbitrary number of neighbors as shown in figure 7. Therefore, the network
analysis code requires a unique data structure that allows each control volume to know its neighbors.
This is achieved by introducing relational properties for each control volume.

       GFSSP has a unique data structure that allows constructing all possible arrangements of
a flow network with no limit of number of elements. The elements of a flow network are fluid nodes
and branches, solid nodes, and conductors. The relationship between a fluid node and a branch is
defined by a set of relational geometric properties. Similarly, the relationship between a solid node
and conductors is defined by a set of relational geometric properties. The connection between solid
and fluid nodes for analyzing conjugate heat transfer is also defined by a set of relational properties.
With the help of these properties, it is possible to define any structure of the network as it progresses
through every junction of the network. The positive or negative flow direction is also defined locally.
Unlike a structured coordinate system, there is no global definition of flow direction and origin. The
development of a flow network can start from any point and can proceed in any direction. This sec-
tion describes the data structure used to develop the governing equations to be described in section 3.

                                2.1 Network Elements and Properties

        GFSSP constructs a flow network with three basic elements: (1) Boundary node, (2) internal
node, and (3) branch. Thermodynamic states such as pressure, temperature, and species concentra-
tions are assigned in boundary nodes. At internal nodes, GFSSP calculates all thermofluid dynamic
variables such as pressure, temperature, enthalpy, entropy, species concentration, and thermophysi-
cal properties such as viscosity and conductivity. Flow rate and velocity are calculated in branches.
A typical flow network consisting of a boundary node, internal node, and branch are shown in
figure 1.

        All nodes and branches are numbered arbitrarily by the user. GFSSP, however, assigns an
index number to each node and branch as the user creates a new node or branch to construct a flow
circuit. For example, NODE(I) represents the node number where I is the pointer of the NODE
array. As nodes are created, additional pointers are added to the array. Similarly, IBRANCH(I)
represents the branch number where I is the pointer of the IBRANCH array. INDEX(I) defines
the type of node. For an internal node, INDEX(I) = 1, whereas for a boundary node, INDEX(I) = 2.
The internal node numbers are also designated as INODE(I), where index I ranges from 1 to the total
number of internal nodes.

       Conjugate heat transfer modeling requires extension of the fluid network to include a net-
work of solid nodes with interfaces between solid and fluid nodes. With this interface, convective and
radiation heat transfer between solid and fluid nodes is modeled. Three additional elements—solid
nodes, ambient nodes, and conductors—become part of the integrated network.

       All elements have properties. The properties can be classified into two categories: geometric
and thermofluid (fig. 2). Geometric properties are again classified into two subcategories: relational
and quantitative. Relational properties define the relationship of the element with the neighboring
elements. Quantitative properties include geometric parameters such as area, length, and volume.

                         2.2 Internal and Boundary Node Thermofluid Properties

       The thermofluid properties (fig. 8) of internal and boundary nodes are:

• Pressure
• Temperature
• Density
• Species concentration
• Enthalpy
• Entropy
• Gas constant

                                  2.3 Internal Node Geometric Properties

        The internal node has geometric properties of two kinds: relational and quantitative. The
relational geometric properties of an internal node are:

• NUMBR(I), which defines the number of branches connected to the node of index I.
• NAMEBR(I,J), which defines the name of branch connected to node with index I; the index J
  extends from 1 to the number of branches connected to the node I, stored in NUMBR(I).

        The quantitative geometric property of an internal node is node volume, which is necessary to
calculate resident mass for unsteady calculation. The resident mass that determines the capacitance
of the node is not required for steady state calculations. The data structure of geometric properties
of an internal node is shown in figure 9. Figure 10 shows an example of relational geometric property
of a node. Following are the relational geometric properties of node 1:

Number of branches connected to node I, NUMBR(I) = 4
Name of the branches connected to node I,
NAMEBR(I, 1) = 31
NAMEBR(I, 2) = 41
NAMEBR(I, 3) = 51
NAMEBR(I, 4) = 12.

                                                2.4 Branch Properties

        The branch has geometric properties of both kinds: relational and quantitative. The rela-
tional geometric properties of a branch are as follows:

• Name of upstream node
• Name of downstream node
• Number of upstream branches
• Name of upstream branches
• Number of downstream branches
• Name of downstream branches
• Index number of resistance option.

        Figure 11 shows the geometric relational property of a branch. An example of those proper-
ties in a typical flow network is shown in figure 10. Each relational property of branch number 12
(IBRANCH(I) = 12) in figure 10 is now defined:

Name of upstream node, IBRUN(I) = 1
Number of upstream branches, NOUBR(I) = 3
Name of upstream branches,
NMUBR(I, 1) = 31
NMUBR(I, 2) = 41
NMUBR(I, 3) = 51

Name of downstream node, IBRDN(I) = 2
Number of downstream branches, NODBR(I) = 3
Name of downstream branches,
NMDBR(I, 1) = 26
NMDBR(I, 2) = 27
NMDBR(I, 3) = 28.

     For unsteady flow, each branch also includes the quantitative geometric and thermofluid
dynamic properties at the previous time step.

        In fluid-solid network for conjugate heat transfer, solid nodes, ambient nodes, and conduc-
tors for heat transfer become part of the GFSSP network. Network elements for conjugate heat
transfer are shown in figure 13. There are four types of conductors: solid to solid conduction, solid
to solid radiation, solid to fluid, and solid to ambient. A typical GFSSP network for conjugate heat
transfer is shown in figure 14. A solid node can be connected to a fluid node and ambient node.
To determine solid temperature, conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer between solid-
solid, solid-fluid, and solid-ambient are computed.

                             3. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION


        GFSSP assumes a Newtonian, nonreacting and one-dimensional flow in the flow circuit.
The flow can be steady or unsteady, laminar or turbulent, incompressible or compressible, with or
without heat transfer, phase change, mixing, and rotation. The analysis of thermofluid dynamics in
a complex network requires resolution of the system into fluid nodes and branches, and solid nodes
and conductors. GFSSP calculates scalar properties such as pressure, temperature, and density at the
nodes, and vector properties such as flow rates, heat fluxes at fluid branches, and conductors, respec-
tively. Fluid nodes can be either internal nodes where properties are calculated or boundary nodes

3.1.1 Mass Conservation Equation

       Following is the mass conservation equation:

                                                mτ +Δτ − mτ        j=n
                                                              = − ∑ m ij .                                        (1)
                                                    Δτ             j=1

        Equation (1) requires that for the unsteady formulation, the net mass flow from a given node
must equate to the rate of change of mass in the control volume. In the steady state formulation,
the left side of the equation is zero. This implies that the total mass flow rate into a node is equal
to the total mass flow rate out of the node. Each term in equation (1) has the unit of lb/s.

3.1.2 Momentum Conservation Equation

        The flow rate in a branch is calculated from the momentum conservation equation (eq. (2)),
which represents the balance of fluid forces acting on a given branch. A typical branch configuration
is shown in figure 21. Inertia, pressure, gravity, friction, and centrifugal forces are considered in the
conservation equation. In addition to these five forces, a source term, S, has been provided in the
equation to input pump characteristics or to input power to a pump in a given branch. If a pump is
located in a given branch, all other forces except pressure are set to zero. The source term, S, is set to
zero in all branches without a pump or other external momentum source:

        The momentum equation consists of 11 terms. There will be no occasion when all 11 terms
will be present in a control volume. Users have the ability to include or exclude all terms except the
pressure term. For example, the friction and shear term will never be active at the same branch. The
shear term will be activated for multidimensional flow modeling when the friction term must be set
to zero. The pressure term will be active under all circumstances. The left-hand side of the momen-
tum equation represents the inertia of the fluid. The surface and body forces applied in the control
volume are assembled in the right-hand side of the equation. Each term of equation (2) has the unit
of lbf. Following are descriptions of the 11 terms:

         (1) Unsteady—This term represents rate of change of momentum with time. For steady state
flow, time step is set to an arbitrary large value and this term is reduced to zero.

         (2) Longitudinal inertia—This term is important when there is a significant change in veloc-
ity in the longitudinal direction due to change in area and density. An upwind differencing scheme is
used to compute the velocity differential. Flow in a converging-diverging nozzle is an example where
this term must be active.

       (3) Transverse inertia—This term is important for multidimensional flow. It accounts for
any longitudinal momentum being transported by a transverse velocity component. Once again, an
upwind differencing scheme is used to compute the velocity differential.

        (4) Pressure—This term represents the pressure gradient in the branch. The pressures are
located at the upstream and downstream face of a branch.


                                                                                                   27
          (5) Gravity—This term represents the effect of gravity. The gravity vector makes an angle
(q) with the assumed flow direction vector. At q = 180°, the fluid is flowing against gravity; at q = 90°,
the fluid is flowing horizontally, and gravity has no effect on the flow.

         (6) Friction—This term represents the frictional effect. Friction was modeled as a product
of Kf and the square of the flow rate and area. Kf is a function of the fluid density in the branch and
the nature of the flow passage being modeled by the branch. The calculation of Kf for different types
of flow passages is described in section 3.1.7.

           (7) Centrifugal—This term in the momentum equation represents the effect of the cen-
trifugal force. This term will be present only when the branch is rotating as shown in figure 21.
Krotation is the factor representing the fluid rotation. Krotation is unity when the fluid and the sur-
rounding solid surface rotate with the same speed. This term also requires knowledge of the dis-
tances from the axis of rotation between the upstream and downstream faces of the branch.

         (8) Shear—This term represents shear force exerted on the control volume by a neighboring
branch. This term is active only for multidimensional flow. The friction term is deactivated when this
term is present. This term requires knowledge of distances between branches to compute the shear
stress.

        (9) Moving boundary—This term represents force exerted on the control volume by a mov-
ing boundary. This term is not active for multidimensional calculations.

        (10) Normal stress—This term represents normal viscous force. This term is important for
highly viscous flows.

        (11) Source—This term represents a generic source term. Any additional force acting on the
control volume can be modeled through the source term. In a system level model, a pump can be
modeled by this term. A detailed description of modeling a pump by this source term (S) appears in
sections 3.1.7.14 and 3.1.7.15.

      A simplified form of the momentum equation has also been provided to compute flow rate for
compressible flow in an orifice. For the ratio of downstream to upstream pressure,

3.1.3 Energy Conservation Equations

        GFSSP solves for the energy conservation equations for both fluid and solid at internal fluid
nodes and solid nodes. The energy conservation equation for fluid is solved for all real fluids with or
without heat transfer. For conjugate heat transfer, the energy conservation equation for solid nodes
is solved in conjunction with the energy equation of fluid nodes. The heat transfer between solid and
fluid nodes is calculated at the interface and used in both equations as source and sink terms.

         3.1.3.1 Energy Conservation Equation of Single Fluid. The energy conservation equation for
node i, shown in figure 20, can be expressed following the first or second law of thermodynamics. The
first law formulation uses enthalpy as the dependent variable, while the second law formulation uses
entropy. The energy conservation equation based on enthalpy is shown in equation (4a):

        Equation (4a) shows that for transient flow, the rate of increase of internal energy in the con-
trol volume is equal to the rate of energy transport into the control volume minus the rate of energy
transport from the control volume plus the rate of work done on the fluid by the pressure force plus

        For a steady state situation, the energy conservation equation, equation (4a), states that the
net energy flow from a given node must equate to zero. In other words, the total energy leaving a node
is equal to the total energy coming into the node from neighboring nodes and from any external heat
sources (Qi) coming into the node and work done on the fluid by pressure and viscous forces. The
MAX operator used in equation (4a) is known as an upwind differencing scheme and has been exten-
sively employed in the numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations in convective heat transfer and
fluid flow applications.9 When the flow direction is not known beforehand, this operator allows the
transport of energy only from its upstream neighbor. In other words, the upstream neighbor influ-
ences its downstream neighbor but not vice versa. The second term on the right-hand side represents
the work done on the fluid by the pressure and viscous force. The difference between the steady and
unsteady formulation lies in the left side of the equation. For a steady state situation, the left side of
equation (4a) is zero, whereas in unsteady cases, the left-hand side of the equation must be evaluated.

       The energy conservation equation based on entropy is shown in equation (4b):

        Equation (4b) shows that for unsteady flow, the rate of increase of entropy in the control
volume is equal to the rate of entropy transport into the control volume plus the rate of entropy
generation in all upstream branches due to fluid friction plus the rate of entropy added to the control
volume due to heat transfer. The first term on the right-hand side of the equation represents the con-
vective transport of entropy from neighboring nodes. The second term represents the rate of entropy
generation in branches connected to the ith node. The third term represents entropy change due to
heat transfer. Each term in equation (4b) has the unit of Btu/R-s.

        3.1.3.2 Energy Conservation Equation of Fluid Species. Energy conservation equations of
fluid species are necessary for modeling fluid mixtures. GFSSP asumes a fluid mixture to be homo-
geneous, and therefore the mass and momentum equations are identical to those of a single fluid.
GFSSP has three options to model a mixture to calculate the temperature and thermophysical prop-
erties of the mixture. The first two options can be used for a mixture of gas and/or liquid as long




30
as there is no change of phase in any mixture component. The third option handles a mixture of
liquid and gas where the liquid or gas may go through a phase change. In all three options the
conservation equations of fluid species are solved as described in section 3.1.4. However, the three
options differ in the way energy equations are handled. In the first option (referred to as the tempera-
ture option), the energy equation is solved in terms of temperature as described in section 3.1.6. In
the second option (referred to as the enthalpy-1 option), a mixture enthalpy was calculated for the
energy conservation equation from enthalpies of fluid species, and temperature was calculated by an
iterative method from a mixture enthalpy equation. In the third option (referred to as the enthalpy-2
option), separate energy equations for each species are solved and the temperature of the mixture is
calculated by averaging the thermal mass (product of mass and specific heat) of all components. In
this section, the energy conservation equations for both enthalpy options are described:

       (1) Enthalpy-1 option—The enthalpy at node i in figure 20 is calculated from the following
equation which is derived from the energy conservation equation expressed in terms of individual
species concentration and enthalpy:

The method of calculating temperature in the enthalpy-1 option is described in section 3.1.6.

is solved. The energy equation for individual species (k) can be expressed as:

        cik = molar concentration of kth species in the ith node.

It may be noted that work input and viscous work were neglected in the species energy equation. The
method of calculating temperature and mixture properties is also described in section 3.1.6.

other solid nodes, fluid nodes, and ambient nodes. Figure 22 shows a typical arrangement where
a solid node is connected with other solid nodes, fluid nodes, and ambient nodes. The energy conser-
vation equation for solid node i can be expressed as:

3.1.4 Fluid Species Conservation Equation

       For a fluid mixture, density is a function of mass fraction of fluid species. In order to calculate
the density of the mixture, the concentration of the individual fluid species within the branch must
be determined. The concentration for the kth species can be written as

          ( mici,k )τ + Δτ − ( mici, k )τ
                                                     {                                                           }
                                              j=n
                                             = ∑ MAX ⎡⎢ − m
                                                           ,0⎤ c − MAX ⎡ m ,0⎤ c   + Si,k .                            (9)
                          Δτ                          ⎣ ij ⎦⎥ j, k      ⎣⎢ ij ⎦⎥ i,k
                                               j =1

       For a transient flow, equation (7) states that the rate of increase of the concentration of the
kth species in the control volume equals the rate of transport of the kth species into the control vol-
ume minus the rate of transport of the kth species out of the control volume plus the generation rate
of the kth species in the control volume.

        Like equation (4), for steady state conditions, equation (7) requires that the net mass flow
of the kth species from a given node must equate to zero. In other words, the total mass flow rate of
the given species into a node is equal to the total mass flow rate of the same species out of that node.
For steady state, the left side of equation (7) is zero. For the unsteady formulation, the resident mass
in the control volume is changing and therefore the left side must be computed. Each term in equa-
tion (5) has the unit of lb/s.

3.1.5 Thermodynamic and Thermophysical Properties

       The momentum conservation equation, equation (2), requires knowledge of the density
and the viscosity of the fluid within the branch. These properties are functions of the temperatures,
pressures, and concentrations of fluid species for a mixture. Three thermodynamic property routines
have been integrated into the program to provide the required fluid property data. GASP10 provides
the thermodynamic and transport properties for 10 fluids. These fluids include hydrogen, oxygen,
helium, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, argon, neon, and fluorine. WASP11
provides the thermodynamic and transport properties for water and steam. For RP-1 fuel, a lookup
table of properties has been generated by a modified version of GASP. An interpolation routine has
been developed to extract the required properties from the tabulated data. GASPAK12 provides ther-
modynamic properties for helium, methane, neon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, oxygen, argon, car-
bon dioxide, hydrogen, parahydrogen, water, RP-1, isobutane, butane, deuterium, ethane, ethylene,
hydrogen sulfide, krypton, propane, xenon, R-11, R-12, R-22, R-32, R-123, R-124, R-125, R-134A,
R-152A, nitrogen trifluoride, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and air.

        3.1.5.1 Equation of State for a Real Fluid. Transient flow calculations require the knowledge
of resident mass in a control volume. The resident mass is calculated from the equation of state for
real fluid that can be expressed as

                                                      pV
                                              m=         .                                         (10)
                                                     zRT

       It may be noted that equation (10) is valid for liquid, gas, and gas-liquid mixture. For an ideal
gas compressibility factor, z is unity. The compressibility factor for real gas is computed from the
equation of state of real fluids using the above-mentioned thermodynamic property programs. For
a two-phase mixture, z is computed from the following relation:

                                                      p
                                            z=            ,                                       (10a)

3.1.6 Mixture Property Calculations

        This section describes the procedures developed for GFSSP to estimate the density and tem-
perature of mixtures of real fluids for all three mixture options. We assume that n fluids are mixing
in the ith node. At node i, pressure (p) and molar concentrations (xk) are known. The problem is to
calculate the density (ρ), temperature (T), specific heat (Cp), specific heat ratio (g), and viscosity (µ)
of the mixture at the ith node.

Density by Amagat’s Model. GFSSP’s default mixture model uses Amagat’s Law of Partial Vol-
umes. It is suitable for liquids and ideal gas mixtures. The density of the mixture in the node (ρmix)
is a function of the densities of the individual components evaluated at the temperature and total
pressure of the node:
                                             1      k=n x
                                                   = Σ      k   .                                    (11)
                                           ρ mix    k=1 ρ k

Density by Dalton’s Model. GFSSP offers the option of evaluating mixture densities using Dalton’s
Law of Partial Pressures for gas mixtures. This option would be used when at least one species of the
gas mixture is at or below its saturation temperature and would be a liquid at the full pressure of the
node, but a gas at the partial pressure of the species. The density of the mixture in the node is a func-
tion of the densities of the individual components evaluated at the temperature of the node and the
partial pressure of the species:
                                                    k=n
                                            ρ mix = ∑ ρ k .                                          (12)
                                                    k=1
.
Other Properties. The compressibility factor of the mixture (Zmix) is calculated from the equation
of state:
                                                  P
                                     Zmix =              .                                    (13)
                                             ρ mixRmixT

The gas constant of the mixture (Rmix) is the universal gas constant divided by the molecular weight
of the mixture:
                                                   R                                                 (14)
                                          Rmix = k=n univ           .
                                                   ∑ xk M k
                                                   k=1

The viscosity, specific heat, and specific heat ratio of the mixture are calculated as the molar averages
of the component properties as shown in equations (15)–(17).

                                                   k=m
                                          µ mix = ∑ xk µk ,                                          (15)

where Cp,k is the molar specific heat and xk is the mole-fraction of the kth species. It is stressed that
this formulation does not handle phase-change and assumes that the specific heat is approximately
constant over the temperature range of interest. It may also be noted that the work input and viscous
work were neglected in this formulation of the energy equations.

      3.1.6.2 Enthalpy-1 Option. The temperature is calculated by an iterative method where
temperature is calculated from the following equation:

                                                   k=nf
                                                    ∑ xi,k hi,k ( pi ,Ti ) − hi = 0 .                    (19)
                                                   k=1

It may be noted that equation (19) assumes Amagat’s model. For Dalton’s model equation (19) can
be rewritten as:
                                               k=nf
                                                   ∑ xi,k hi,k ( pi,k ,Ti ) − hi = 0 .                  (19a)
                                                   k=1

Note that partial pressure has been used in equation (19a).

        Once the temperature is calculated, the properties of individual species will be calculated
from pressure and enthalpy of the individual species. For a gaseous mixture, the mixture properties
will then be calculated by taking molar average of species properties as shown in equations (15)–(17).


                                                                                                          37

3.1.7 Friction Calculations

       It was mentioned earlier in this TP that the friction term in the momentum equation is
expressed as a product of Kf , the square of the flow rate and the flow area. Empirical information
is necessary to estimate Kf . Several options for flow passage resistance are listed in table 5. In this
subsection, the expression of Kf for all resistance options is described.

        3.1.7.1 Pipe Flow (Branch Option 1). Figure 23 shows the pipe resistance option parameters
that are required by GFSSP. This option considers that the branch is a pipe with length (L), diameter
(D), and surface roughness (ε). For this option, Kf can be expressed as:

                                                             8 fL
                                           Kf =                         ,                             (22)

where ru is the density of the fluid at the upstream node of a given branch. The derivation of Kf for
pipe flow is covered in appendix A.

       The Darcy friction factor (f) is determined from the Colebrook equation,16 which is expressed
as:

where e /D and Re are the surface roughness factor and Reynolds number, respectively. It may be
mentioned that all pipe flow options assume fully developed flow.

        3.1.7.2 Flow Through a Restriction (Branch Option 2). This option regards the branch
as a flow restriction with a given flow coefficient (CL) and area (A). For this option, Kf can be
expressed as:
                                                    1
                                       Kf =                   .                              (24)

      White describes a procedure to estimate the friction factor in a noncircular duct.17 This
procedure consists of the following steps:

       (1) Estimate the hydraulic diameter of the cross section: Dh = (4)(area)/perimeter.
       (2) Estimate the Poiseuille number (Po) for a particular cross section. The Poiseuille num-
ber can be expressed as a polynomial function of aspect ratio as shown in equation (27). Table 6
provides the coefficients for different geometries.

       3.1.7.6 Thick Orifice (Branch Option 6). Figure 27 shows the thick orifice resistance option
parameters that are required by GFSSP. This option models the branch as a thick orifice with
a pipe diameter of D1, an orifice diameter of D2, and orifice length of Lor. This option should be
used if Lor  /D2 ≤ 5. If Lor  /D2 > 5, the user should use a square expansion, option 8, or a square
reduction, option 7. For option 6, Kf can be expressed as in equation (33). However, the K1 in
equation (33) is calculated18 from the following expressions:

The Reynolds number and friction factor that are utilized within these expressions are based on the

model determines that the flow direction is in the reverse direction, the user will have to replace the
reduction with an expansion and rerun the model.

       3.1.7.9 Rotating Annular Duct (Branch Option 9). Figure 30 shows the rotating annular
duct resistance option parameters that are required by GFSSP. This option considers the branch
as a rotating annular duct. The length, outer radius, and inner radius of the annular passage are L,
ro, and ri, respectively. The inner surface is rotating at N rpm (N = 30 w /ρ). For this option, Kf can
be expressed as:

        The friction factor (f ) in equation (42) was calculated from the following expressions:19

        3.1.7.10 Rotating Radial Duct (Branch Option 10). Figure 31 shows the rotating radial duct
resistance option parameters that are required by GFSSP. This option considers the branch as a rotat-
ing radial duct. This option accounts only for the frictional losses encountered with this type of flow.
Since centrifugal effects are also important in a rotating radial duct, the user must select this option
and activate the rotational term in the momentum conservation equation (eq. (2)). The activation of
the rotational term is explained in section 5.3.2 (fig. 68).


                                                                                    D

       The length and diameter of the duct are L and D, respectively. The rotational speed is ω rad/s.

       3.1.7.14 Pump Characteristics (Branch Option 14). This option considers the branch
as a pump with given characteristics. The pump characteristics must be expressed as a curve fit
of pressure rise versus flow rate:

                                         ! p = A0 + B 0 m! + C0 m! 2 ,                             (53)
where

        D p = pressure rise (lbf/ft2).
        m! = flow rate (lbm/s).

The user must input the intercept A0, and the first and second order terms, B0 and C0, of the curve
fit. The momentum source (S) in equation (2) is then expressed as:

                                                   S = D p A .                                     (54)

        3.1.7.15 Pump Horsepower (Branch Option 15). This option considers the branch
as a pump with a given horsepower (P) and efficiency (h). The momentum source (S) in equation (2)
is then expressed as:

       3.1.7.16 Valve With a Given Loss Coefficient (Branch Option 16). This option considers the
branch as a valve with a given flow coefficient (Cv). The flow coefficient is the volume (in gallons) of
water at 60 °F that will flow per minute through a valve with a pressure drop of 1 psi across the valve.
The recommended formula for Cv determination with water is:

                                                           1
                                                Cv = Q        ,                                    (56)

where Q is the volumetric flow rate in gpm of water at 60 °F and ∆  p is the pressure drop in psia. For
this option, Kf can be expressed as:

                                                      4.68 × 105

       3.1.7.17 Joule-Thompson Device (Branch Option 17). This option considers the branch as
a Viscojet,23 which is a specific type of flow resistance with relatively large flow passages with very
high pressure drops. The flow rate through the Viscojet is given by:

                                                      Vf
                                     w = 10,000 kv         Δp S (1 − x ) ,                         (58)
                                                      LΩ

where w is the flow rate in lbm/hr, LΩ is the resistance of the fluid device, kv is an empirical factor,
and Vf is the viscosity correction factor.

                                                                                                     51

        3.1.7.18 Control Valve (Branch Option 18). This is an exclusively transient option that consid-
ers the branch as a control valve that monitors the pressure at some arbitrary point downstream of
the valve and opens and closes to maintain that pressure within a prescribed tolerance. This option
was originally developed for use with the pressurization option to model on/off, or ‘bang-bang,’ pres-
surization systems as shown in figure 34. The valve is regarded as a flow restriction with a given flow
coefficient (CL) and area (A), and uses equation (24) to calculate Kf for the valve.

       The remaining inputs for the control valve option define its open/close characteristics. The
suboption determines the type of open/close response of the valve (instantaneous, linear, or nonlin-
ear) and the valve initial position describes whether the valve is initially open or closed. The control
node defines the location in the model where the control valve option is to monitor and maintain the
pressure while the pressure tolerance file name provides the code with the name of the file containing
the pressure tolerance data for the control valve.

       For a linear open/close response, the time to open/close and the number of time steps needed
to complete that response are provided as additional inputs. If the length of the valve open/close
time steps does not match the global time step, the program will temporarily change the global time
step until the valve has fully opened/closed. The area of the valve will be linearly interpolated at each
time step.

        Finally, for a nonlinear open/close response, the file names for the open and close characteris-
tics of the valve are required as additional inputs. The files detail the valve CL and area as functions
of time from the start of valve opening/closing.

        3.1.7.19 User-Defined Resistance (Branch Option 19). This option allows users to create
a new resistance option that is not available in the GFSSP library. Once this option is chosen, the
user is required to supply the coding for calculating Kf for this option in the User Subroutine to
be described in the following section. In the preprocessor, the user is required to supply the cross-
sectional area of the branch.

        3.1.7.20 Heat Exchanger Core (Branch Option 20). This option considers the branch as
a heat exchanger core. In a typical heat exchanger core (fig. 35), the fluid goes past a tube bank to
allow heat transfer between fluids in the main duct and fluids within the tubes. The free flow area is
reduced and there is a larger surface area of contact between the fluid and solid walls. Sections 1 and
2 in figure 35 represent inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger core, respectively. The pressure drop
through the heat exchanger core can be expressed as:24

       3.1.7.21 Parallel Tube (Branch Option 21). This option considers the branch as a parallel

        3.1.7.22 Compressible Orifice (Branch Option 22). This option considers the branch as an
orifice for compressible flow. In this option, unlike other options, flow rate is calculated from a sim-
plified momentum equation (eq. (3c)). There is no need to calculate Kf for this option. The input to
this option is identical to option 2 (flow-through restriction).

        3.1.7.23 Labyrinth Seal/Egli Correlation (Branch Option 23). This option provides an alter-
native formulation of flow resistances through the labyrinth seal (branch option 11). Egli developed
a formulation of flow-through labyrinth seal based on the actual flow characteristics typical for
a sharp-edged orifice.25 Based on the general relations between leakage and number of throttling
passages, flow resistance was calculated. The formulation also considered the effect of kinetic energy
being carried from one throttling into the next. The input parameters (fig. 32) for this option are
inner radius, clearance, pitch, number of teeth, and tooth tip width.

        3.1.7.24 Fixed Flow (Branch Option 24). This option fixes flow rate in a given branch. The
fixed flow branch can only be located adjacent to a boundary node. With this new option, the user
can prescribe either pressure or flow rate as a boundary condition.

The pump characteristics of a positive displacement pump are expressed as: Δp = A + Cm m ,
where A = ! m! m! ; C = –a, where a = 1 × 1025. Substituting A and C, one gets m = m m / m .

        There is a word of caution about the use of this option. The calculated pressure field may not
be realistic as flow rate is calculated independent of pressure differential.

                                                3.2 Solution Procedure

        GFSSP numerically solves the governing equations described in the previous section to com-
pute pressure, temperature, flow rate, and other fluid properties in a given flow circuit. The math-
ematical closure is described in table 8 where each variable and the designated governing equation to
solve that variable are listed. It may be noted that the pressure is calculated from the mass conserva-
tion equation although pressure does not explicitly appear in equation (1). This is, however, possible
in the iterative scheme where pressures are corrected to reduce the residual error in mass conser-
vation equation. This practice was first implemented in a semi-implicit pressure linked equation
(SIMPLE) algorithm proposed by Patankar and Spalding26 and commonly referred to as ‘pressure
based’ algorithm in computational fluid dynamics literature. The momentum conservation equation
(eq. (2)) which contains both pressure and flow rate is solved to calculate the flow rate. The strong
coupling of pressure and flow rate requires that mass and momentum conservation equations are
solved simultaneously.

        The energy conservation equation can either be expressed in terms of enthalpy or entropy.
The temperature, density, and other thermophysical properties, such as viscosity, conductivity, and
specific heats are computed from pressure and enthalpy or entropy using thermodynamic property
programs, GASP10/WASP11 or GASPAK.12 In flow circuits where solid to fluid heat transfer is pres-
ent, the energy conservation equation for solids is solved to calculate the solid temperature. The rate
of heat transfer between solid to fluid appears as a source or sink term in the energy conservation
equations of fluid and solid.

       For a mixture, the conservation equations of species are solved to compute the mass fraction
of species. There are three options for solving the energy equation for a mixture as discussed in sec-
tion 3.1.3.2. The method of calculating thermodynamic and thermophysical peoperties of all three
options has been described in section 3.1.6.

        For a transient problem, fluid mass is required in mass and momentum conservation equa-
tions (eqs. (1) and (2)). GFSSP uses the thermodynamic equation of state (eq. (10)) to calcu-
late resident mass in an internal node where density, compressibility factor, and temperature are
computed.

        There are two types of numerical methods available to solve a set of nonlinear coupled
algebraic equations: the successive substitution method and the Newton-Raphson method. In the
successive substitution method, each equation is expressed explicitly to calculate one variable. The
previously calculated variable is then substituted into the other equations to calculate another vari-
able. In one iterative cycle, each equation is visited. The iterative cycle is continued until the differ-
ence in the values of the variables in successive iterations becomes negligible. The advantages of the
successive substitution method are its simplicity to program and its low code overhead. The main
limitation, however, is finding an optimum order for visiting each equation in the model. This visit-
ing order, which is called the information flow diagram, is crucial for convergence. Under-relaxation
(partial substitution) of variables is often required to obtain numerical stability. Details of the
suc-cessive substitution method appear in appendix B.

        In the Newton-Raphson method, the simultaneous solution of a set of nonlinear equations
is achieved through an iterative guess and correction procedure. Instead of solving for the variables
directly, correction equations are constructed for all of the variables. The intent of the correction
equations is to eliminate the error in each equation. The correction equations are constructed in two
steps: (1) The residual errors in all of the equations are estimated and (2) the partial derivatives of


56
  List of Figures



all of the equations, with respect to each variable, are calculated. The correction equations are then
solved by the Gaussian elimination method. These corrections are then applied to each variable,
which completes one iteration cycle. These iterative cycles of calculations are repeated until the resid-
ual error in all of the equations is reduced to a specified limit. The Newton-Raphson method does
not require an information flow diagram; therefore, it has improved convergence characteristics. The
main limitation to the Newton-Raphson method is its requirement for a large amount of
computer memory. Details of the Newton-Raphson method appear in appendix C.

        In GFSSP, a combination of the successive substitution method and the Newton-Raphson
method is used to solve the set of equations. This method is called SASS (simultaneous adjustment
with successive substitution) (fig. 38). In this scheme, the mass and momentum conservation equa-
tions are solved by the Newton-Raphson method. The energy and specie conservation equations are
solved by the successive substitution method. The underlying principle for making such a division
was that the equations that are more strongly coupled are solved by the Newton-Raphson method.
The equations that are not strongly coupled with the other set of equations are solved by the suc-
cessive substitution method. Thus, the computer memory requirement can be significantly reduced
while maintaining superior numerical convergence characteristics.

        SASS has two options available. In one option, there are two iterative loops—inner and outer.
In the inner iterative loop, mass and momentum conservation equations are solved by the Newton-
Raphson scheme. For unsteady formulation, the equation of state is also solved by the Newton-
Raphson scheme in addition to mass and momentum conservation equations. In the outer loop,
the energy and specie conservation equations are solved by the successive substitution method. The
outer loop also calculates the density and other thermodynamic and thermophysical properties and
the flow resistance coefficient (Kf) which is a function of density. This option is called the nonsimul-
taneous option. The total number of iterations in this option can be expressed as:

                                                    no
                                           Ntotal = ! ni ,                                         (64)
                                                    i=1

where no is the number of outer iterations and ni is the number of inner iterations. The inner iterative
cycle is terminated when the normalized maximum correction (D max) is less than the convergence
criterion (Cc). Dmax is determined from

NB and NN are the number of branches and nodes, respectively, in a flow circuit.

       In the second option, there is only one iterative loop. During the iterative cycle mass,
momentum and the equation of state are first solved by the Newton-Raphson scheme. Then
the energy and specie conservation equations are solved by the successive substitution method.
The iterative cycle is terminated when the normalized maximum correction (D max) is less than
the convergence criterion (Cc).

       This option is called the simultaneous option and is more efficient than the nonsimultane-
ous option. The nonsimultaneous option, however, is more numerically stable. With the help of
a logical variable, SIMUL, the user can switch between the first and second options. More detailed
discussion of both options appears in section 4.

                                   4. COMPUTER PROGRAM


        The purpose of this section is to describe the structure and major functions of the program.
The main objective of the computer program is to implement the numerical algorithm described in
section 3 in a way which is easy to follow, modular to allow for future extension, robust, and free of
errors. There are seven major functions of the computer program:

       (1) Development of a flow circuit with fluid and solid nodes with branches and conductors.
       (2) Development of an indexing system or data structure to define a network of fluid
       		 and solid nodes with branches and conductors.
       (3) Generation of conservation equations of fluid mass, momentum, energy, species, and
       		 solid temperatures in respective nodes and branches.
       (4) Calculation of thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of the fluid and solid
       		 in nodes.
       (5) Numerical solution of conservation equations.
       (6) Input/output.
       (7) User-defined modules.

        GFSSP consists of three major modules: Graphical User Interface (GUI module), Solver and
Property (SP) module, and User Subroutine (US) module (fig. 39). Functions (1) and (6) are done
in the GUI module, functions (2) through (6) are done in the SP module, and function (7) is done in
the US module. A distinct boundary is maintained among the GUI, SP, and US modules. The GUI
and US modules supply the information to the SP module through an input data file and User Sub-
routines. The SP module returns an output data file and plot files for graphical and text display of
results. The maintenance of a strict boundary among the three modules is a key feature of GFSSP
that makes the code easy to use, maintain, and upgrade. Users are not required to know the details
of the computational method to become a proficient user of the code. The modularity also helps the
developer to add new capabilities with minimum impact to the existing code. This section describes
the SP and US modules. The GUI module is described in section 5.

        Figure 39 shows GFSSP’s process flow diagram to describe the interaction among GUI, SP,
and US modules. Users create a flow circuit in the GUI, visual thermofluid analyzer for system and
components (VTASC) by a ‘point, drag, and click’ method. VTASC creates an input data file that
is read by the SP module. The user runs the SP module from VTASC, which also reads the output
data file generated by the SP module to display the results in the GUI. The VTASC also allows users
to plot time-dependent results in Winplot.13 Specialized input to the model can be supplied through
User Subroutines that also interact with the SP module. Such specialized input includes time-
dependent processes, nonlinear boundary conditions, and external mass, momentum, and energy
sources, customized output, and new resistance and fluid options.

                                           4.2 Solver and Property Module

       The main routine and the associated set of subroutines perform seven major functions that
include:

       (1) Reading of the input data file generated by VTASC, GFSSP’s graphical user interface.
       (2) Generation of the trial solution based on the initial guess.
       (3) Supply time-dependent boundary conditions for unsteady flow.
       (4) Numerical solution of conservation equations by the SASS scheme.
       (5) Interaction with thermodynamic property programs to calculate properties at nodes.
       (6) Calculation of flow resistances in the branches.
       (7) Create text output and plot files.

The flow charts of the SP module for nonsimultaneous and simultaneous schemes are shown
in figures 40 and 41, respectively.

4.2.1 Nonsimultaneous Solution Scheme

        The flow chart of nonsimultaneous solution algorithm is shown in figure 40. In this scheme,
there are two iteration cycles—inner and outer. In the inner iteration cycle, the mass and momentum
conservation equation and resident equation of state are solved by the Newton-Raphson scheme
until convergence. During this iteration cycle, property and resistance coefficients are not updated.
In the outer iteration cycle, the energy and concentration equations are solved and density and resis-
tance coefficients are updated and a new set of Newton-Raphson iteration is started. The outer
iteration loop is repeated until the fractional change in density, resistance coefficient, and enthalpy
is negligible.

        The subroutine READIN reads the input data file. The subroutine INIT generates a trial
solution by interacting with the thermodynamic property codes GASP, WASP, and GASPAK, or
the property tables. Subroutine BOUND reads any applicable time-dependent boundary conditions
from the model history files. Subroutine NEWTON conducts the Newton-Raphson solution of the
mass conservation, flow rate, and energy conservation equations with the help of the subroutines
EQNS, COEF, SOLVE, and UPDATE. The subroutine EQNS generates the equations. The coeffi-
cients of the correction equations are calculated in COEF. The correction equations are solved by the
Gaussian Elimination method in SOLVE. After applying the corrections, the variables are updated
in subroutine UPDATE. This cycle of calculations is repeated until the corrections are negligible.
The energy conservation equation is then solved in subroutine ENTHALPY or ENTROPY by the
successive substitution scheme. For problems involving fluid mixture subroutine, MASSC is called to
solve species conservation equations. For conjugate heat transfer problems, the energy conservation
equations for solid nodes are solved in subroutine TSOLID or TSOLIDNR. The resistance for each
branch is calculated in RESIST following the calculation of fluid densities at each node in the sub-
routine DENSITY. The flow resistance coefficients (Kf) for each branch are computed in subroutines
KFACT1 through KFACT24 depending upon the resistance option selected for a particular branch.
The convergence of the numerical scheme is checked to determine if the cycle of calculation needs to
be repeated. The solver module also calls 25 User Subroutines from various subroutines as described
in section 4.3.

4.2.2 Simultaneous Solution Scheme

        The flowchart of the simultaneous solution algorithm is shown in figure 41. The function-
ality of subroutine READIN, INIT, and BOUND is identical to the nonsimultaneous scheme. In
this scheme, there is only one iteration loop. The enthalpy (or entropy), concentrations, density, and
resistance coefficient are updated in each Newton-Raphson iteration. Therefore, in each Newton-
Raphson iteration, subroutine ENTHALPY or ENTROPY, MASSC, TSOLID or TSOLIDNR,
RESIST, and DENSITY are called to compute and update all variables. The iteration loop is con-
trolled in subroutine NEWTON. The interaction of the SP and US modules is identical to the non-
simultaneous scheme.

4.2.3 Conjugate Heat Transfer

        GFSSP can model solid to fluid heat transfer which is commonly known as conjugate heat
transfer. There are two solution options for solving the conservation equation for solid nodes: suc-
cessive substitution and Newton-Raphson. The successive substitution scheme is implemented in
subroutine TSOLID and the flowchart of the subroutine is shown in figure 42. Subroutine TSOLID
calls STCOND, CONVHC, RADHCF, RADHCSA, RADHCSSR, and SLDCP to estimate dif-
ferent terms of the conservation equation. STCOND determines the thermal conductivity from the
property table. CONVHC determines the heat transfer coefficient from GFSSP’s built-in correla-
tion. CONVHC also calls subroutine USRHCF to allow the user to provide a problem-specific heat
transfer coefficient. RADHCF, RADHCSA, and RADHCSSR are three subroutines called from
TSOLID to compute radiation heat transfer from solid to fluid, solid to ambient, and solid to solid,
respectively. SLDCP determines the specific heat from the property table for computing the transient
term. Subroutine QDOTSSCR calculates solid to solid conduction and radiation heat transfer.

        The Newton-Raphson scheme is implemented in subroutine TSOLIDNR. The flowchart
of this subroutine is shown in figure 43. TSEQNS, TSCOEF, and GAUSSY are three subroutines
that perform the major functions of the Newton-Raphson scheme. The residuals are calculated in
TSEQNS. The flowchart of subroutine TSEQNS is shown in figure 44. TSCOEF calculates the coef-
ficient matrix. The correction equations are solved in GAUSSY. After convergence of the numerical
scheme, subroutine QDOTSSCR calculates solid to solid conduction and radiation heat transfer.

4.2.4 Thermodynamic Property Package

        The thermodynamic property packages included in GFSSP consist of three separate pro-
grams: GASP,10 WASP,11 and GASPAK12; it also includes tabulated data for RP-1. The GASP and
WASP programs consist of a number of subroutines. GASP provides the thermodynamic properties
for 10 fluids: helium, methane, neon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide,
fluorine, and hydrogen. WASP provides the thermodynamic properties of water. RP-1 properties are
provided in the form of tables. Subroutine RP1 searches for the required property values from these
tables. GASPAK provides thermodynamic properties for helium, methane, neon, nitrogen, carbon
monoxide, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, parahydrogen, water, isobutane, butane, deute-
rium, ethane, ethylene, hydrogen sulfide, krypton, propane, xenon, R-11, R-12, R-22, R-32, R-123,
R-124, R-125, R-134A, R-152A, nitrogen trifluoride, and ammonia.

        The thermodynamic property subroutines are called from two GFSSP subroutines: INIT and
DENSITY. In subroutine INIT, enthalpies and densities are computed from given pressures and
temperatures at the boundary and internal nodes. In subroutine DENSITY, density, temperatures,
specific heats, and specific heat ratios are calculated from given pressures and enthalpies at each
node.

                                         4.3 User Subroutines

         Experienced users have the ability to introduce additional capability into the code through User
Subroutines. Twenty-three User Subroutines are called from various locations of the solver module.
The caller and called subroutines are shown in figure 45. All necessary GFSSP variables are available
through COMMON BLOCK and subroutine arguments. Users can develop many additional capa-
bilities by developing their own code in User Subroutines. These may include the following:

       (1) Heat or mass transfer model in any node of a circuit.
       (2) External forces applied on the fluid in any branch of the circuit. Users also have the abil-
           ity to modify the existing formulation of various forces already existing in the code.
       (3) Variable time step, geometry, and boundary conditions for a time-dependent problem.
       (4) New resistance or fluid options.
       (5) Develop customized output and/or plot file.

       Appropriate use of User Subroutines requires some familiarity with GFSSP variables
and indexing practice. Common block variables are explained in appendix D. GFSSP indexing
practice and User Subroutines are explained in the following sections. The use of User
Subroutines has also been demonstrated in example 10.

4.3.1 Indexing Practice

        Users who will be using User Subroutines to add new features into the code need to under-
stand the indexing practice. In order to develop the coding to incorporate new features, users need to

of ambient nodes in a given model. Subroutine INDEXA finds the address location for a given ambi-
ent node.

in an ICONSS-array. The total number of elements in the ICONSS-array is NSSC, which represents
the total number of solid to solid conductors in a given model. Subroutine INDEXSSC finds the
address location for a given solid to solid conductor.

4.3.2 Description of User Subroutines

        Additional capabilities can be added to the code by the utilization of User Subroutines.
Twenty-three blank subroutines are provided with a common block of variables. These subroutines
are called from various locations in the SP module as shown in figure 45. A few subroutines also pass
pertinent local variables through arguments. Users can develop their code to add new capabilities
through use of these variables. A short description of each subroutine is now provided.
A descrip-tion of all common block variables appears in appendix D and listing of blank User
Subroutines are provided in appendix E.

       4.3.2.1 Subroutine FILNUM. This subroutine is called from the main program at the begin-
ning of computation to assign file numbers to integer names. All file numbers are assigned integer
variable names in the MAIN routine of GFSSP. All file numbers are listed in this subroutine for users
to make them aware what file numbers are already in use. It also includes 10 additional file numbers
for possible use in User Subroutines. Users need to make sure they do not use the existing file numbers.

       4.3.2.2 Subroutine USRINT. This subroutine is called from subroutine INIT. This allows the
user to assign different initial values and steady state boundary conditions and overwrite the values
assigned in subroutine INIT.

      4.3.2.3 Subroutine SORCEM. This subroutine is called from Subroutine EQNS. It has two
arguments:

IPN – Address location of node
TERMU – Transient term of mass conservation equation.

       In this subroutine, users can define any additional mass sources, EMS (IPN), at any internal
node. An alternative form of the transient term in the mass conservation equation (eq. (1)) can be
used by overwriting the existing TERMU.

       4.3.2.4 Subroutine SORCEF. This subroutine is called from subroutine EQNS. This sub-
routine allows users the ability to redefine each term in the momentum equation and provides an
opportunity to add external momentum sources to any branch. It has 13 arguments:

       I – Address location of branch
       TERM0 – Unsteady term in momentum conservation equation
       TERM1 – Longitudinal inertia
       TERM2 – Pressure gradient
       TERM3 – Gravity force
       TERM4 – Friction force
       TERM5 – Centrifugal force
       TERM6 – External momentum source due to pump
       TERM7 – Momentum source due to transverse flow (multidimensional model)
       TERM8 – Momentum source due to shear (multidimensional model)
       TERM9 – Variable geometry unsteady term
       TERM10 – Normal stress
       TERM100 – User-supplied momentum source

        The first argument is the address location of the branch. The other 12 arguments represent
the various terms of the momentum equation. The algebraic form of each term is described in equa-
tion (2). However, GFSSP’s Newton-Raphson scheme solves the equation in the following form:

                                           (
                                       F x1,x2 ,x3 ,…xnl = 0 . )                                  (68)


        The momentum equation in subroutine EQNS, therefore, appears as:

          TERM0 + TERM1 – TERM2 – TERM3 + TERM4 – TERM5 – TERM6
          + TERM7 – TERM8 + TERM9 – TERM10 – TERM100 = 0.                                         (69)

    4.3.2.5 Subroutine SORCEQ. This subroutine is called from subroutine ENTHALPY (if
SECONDL is false) or from subroutine ENTROPY (if SECONDL is true). It has two arguments:

       IPN – Address location of node
       TERMD – Component of linearized source term appearing in the denominator of the enthalpy
or entropy equation.

        This subroutine allows the user to introduce a heat source or sink at any internal node. In
numerical calculation it is often necessary to linearize the heat source to ensure numerical stability.
Suppose one needs to account for heat transfer from the wall at a given temperature (say Twall ) to
the fluid at TF in the energy conservation equation. The additional heat source can be expressed as:
                                       .
                                      Q wall = hA(T wall − T F ) .                                (70)

      In a linearized formulation of the energy conservation equation, hcATwall appears in the
numerator and hcA/Cp appears in the denominator of the equation as shown below:

                                               j=n
                                               ∑ a j h j + hc ATwall
                                       hi =
                                               j=1
                                                j=n
                                                                       .                          (71)
                                                ∑ a j + hc A / Cp
                                                j=1
Example of coding:

        SORCEH(IPN) = HC*HAREA*TWALL
        TERMD = HC*HAREA/CPNODE(IPN)

where
        HC = heat transfer coefficient (Btu/ft2-s-R)
        HAREA = heat transfer area (ft2)
        TWALL = wall temperature (°R)
        CPNODE(IPN) = specific heat of fluid at IPN (Btu/lbm–R).

An example of adding a heat source is shown in example 8 in section 6.

                                                                                                    73

        4.3.2.6 Subroutine SORCEC. This subroutine is called from subroutine MASSC. This sub-
routine allows users to introduce a source or sink of species at any internal node. An example of uses
of this subroutine appears in example 10 of section 5.

       4.3.2.7 Subroutine SORCETS. This subroutine is called from subroutine TSOLID or TSOL-
IDNR depending upon whether the energy conservation equation for solid is solved by successive
substitution or the Newton-Raphson method. This subroutine allows users to introduce heat source
or sink at any solid node.

      4.3.2.8. Subroutine KFUSER. This subroutine is called from subroutine RESIST. In this
subroutine, users can introduce a new resistance option in any branch. It has nine arguments:

       I – Address location of branch
       RHOU – Upstream node density
       EMUU – Upstream node viscosity
       RHOUL – Upstream node liquid density
       EMUL – Upstream node liquid viscosity
       RHOUV – Upstream node vapor density
       EMUUV – Upstream node vapor viscosity
       ISATU – Flag set to 1 if node is saturated with liquid/vapor mixture
       AKNEW – Kf for the branch in consideration.

Users must provide all input data to calculate Kf for the branch in this subroutine.

       4.3.2.9 Subroutine PRPUSER. This subroutine will be used when users want to integrate
a separate thermodynamic property package instead of built-in thermodynamic property packages,
GASP, WASP, and GASPAK.

       4.3.2.10 Subroutine TSTEP. This subroutine is called from the main program at the start of
each time step. In this subroutine the user has the opportunity to overwrite and prescribe a new time
step.

        4.3.2.11 Subroutine BNDUSER. This subroutine is called from subroutine BOUND. In this
subroutine users can modify boundary conditions and geometry at each time step for an unsteady
model. This subroutine must be used when users want to integrate a separate thermodynamic prop-
erty package instead of the built-in thermodynamic property packages, GASP and WASP. In an
unsteady model, boundary conditions are specified at each time step. The thermodynamic properties
at the boundary node must be calculated at the start of a new time step. Example 8 in section 6 dem-
onstrates the use of this subroutine.

       In order to modify the geometry, users can make use of six allocated arrays (BRPR1 through
BRPR6) that store the branch parameters for all resistance options. Table 9 describes the allocation
of branch parameters of all resistance options to these six arrays.

      4.3.2.12 Subroutine PRNUSER. This subroutine is called from subroutine PRINT. In this
subroutine users can add additional information in GFSSP output files or can create new output files.

        4.3.2.13 Subroutine USRSET. This subroutine is called from subroutine READIN if
USETUP is set to true. This subroutine allows users to set up their own model instead of using
the GFSSP preprocessors. When this option is activated, GFSSP reads the title, input, and out-
put filenames from the data file. The user must provide other necessary information for the model.
Only experienced users may have a need to use this subroutine.




                                                                                                                                       75

       4.3.2.14 Subroutine USRHCF. This subroutine is called from subroutine CONVHC. It has
two arguments:

       NUMBER – Address location of solid to fluid conductor
       HCF – Heat transfer coefficient in Btu/s-ft2-°R.

This subroutine allows users to calculate heat transfer coefficient by a correlation provided by the
user to overwrite the heat transfer coefficient calculated by GFSSP’s solver module.

       4.3.2.15 Subroutine USRADJUST. This subroutine is called from MAIN. Users can adjust
the boundary condition and introduce additional iterative cycle to achieve any desired design goal.

        4.3.2.16 Subroutine SORCEHXQ. This subroutine is called from subroutine ENTHALPYX,
which solves the energy equation for individual species (enthalpy-2 option for mixture, sec. 3.1.3.2).
It has three arguments:

       IPN – Address location of node
       TERMD – Component of linearized source term appearing in the denominator of the species
enthalpy equation
       K – Index of the fluid species in the mixture.

This subroutine allows the user to introduce a heat source or sink at any internal node for a given
species. The use of TERMD has been explained in the context of subroutine SORCEQ.

       4.3.2.17 Subroutine KFADJUST. This subroutine is called from subroutine RESIST to allow
users to modify the Kf value of a particular branch. It has nine arguments:

       I – Address location of branch
       RHOU – Upstream node density
       EMUU – Upstream node viscosity
       RHOUL – Upstream node liquid density
       EMUL – Upstream node liquid viscosity
       RHOUV – Upstream node vapor density
       EMUV – Upstream node vapor viscosity
       ISATU – Index to designate saturation condition (ISATU = 1) of upstream node
       AKNEW – Kf for the branch in consideration.

       4.3.2.18 Subroutine PRPADJUST. This subroutine is called from subroutine DENSITY and
allows users to adjust any thermodynamic or thermophysical properties, if necessary.

       4.3.2.19 Subroutine TADJUST. This subroutine is called from subroutine MIXPROP which
calculates mixture properties and temperature for the enthalpy-2 option of modeling fluid mixture.
This subroutine allows users to adjust node temperature, if necessary.

       4.3.2.20 Subroutine PADJUST. This subroutine is called from subroutine NEWTONSS
which controls the Newton-Raphson scheme. This subroutine allows users to adjust node pressure,
if necessary.

        4.3.2.21 Subroutine FLADJUST. This subroutine is called from subroutine NEWTONSS
which controls the Newton-Raphson scheme. This subroutine allows users to adjust mass flow rate
in the branch, if necessary.

        4.3.2.22 Subroutine HADJUST. This subroutine is called from subroutine ENTHALPY,
which solves for enthalpy of single fluid, and subroutine ENTHALPYX, which solves for enthalpies
of all species in the mixture (enthalpy-2 option). This subroutine allows users to adjust enthalpies,
if necessary.

       4.3.2.23 Subroutine USRMDG. This subroutine is called from MAIN. This subroutine allows
users to modify geometrical parameters for a multidimensional grid.

       4.3.2.24 Utility Subroutines and Functions. User Subroutine code will sometimes use linear
interpolation, for example, when calculating boundary conditions as a function of time. The user
may choose to use GFSSP’s built-in subroutine INTERPOL:

         CALL INTERPOL(XVALUE, N, XARRAY, YARRAY, YVALUE)

Input:
         XVALUE – x value at which y will be interpolated
         N – size of arrays XARRAY and YARRAY
         XARRAY(N) – array of increasing x values
         YARRAY(N) – array of y values corresponding to XARRAY

Output:
      YVALUE – y value interpolated at XVALUE

Subroutine INTERPOL is for linear interpolation only. It does not extrapolate. Out-of-range
values will be set equal to the first or last value in YARRAY, as appropriate.

       User Subroutines may also make use of various unit conversion functions to convert between
SI and English units. For example:

         REAL FUNCTION KW_BTUS(VALUE)

will convert the power in kW stored in variable VALUE to BTU/s. These conversion functions
are described in the User Subroutine write-up of appendix E.




                                                                                                  77

        4.3.2.25 Provision of Fluid Property Call From User Subroutine. GFSSP calculates fluid
properties in every node as functions of (1) pressure and temperature, (2) pressure and enthalpy,
or (3) pressure and entropy. Most of the property package calls were standardized by placing them
in one of three universal property call subroutines: PROPS_PT, PROPS_PH, and PROPS_PS. An
additional subroutine called PROPS_PSATX is available to users who desire saturation properties at
a given pressure. These subroutines call the GASP/WASP programs, RP-1 interpolation tables, and
User Fluid interpolation tables. They do not call the GASPAK property program.

       An advantage of the universal property call subroutines is that it provides a utility for writing
User Subroutines. For example, when calculating a convection coefficient using a film temperature
(mean of the fluid and solid node temperatures), the user will want properties at a different tempera-
ture than the current node temperature. These can be provided with a call to PROPS_PT. Two-phase
convection coefficient correlations may require properties of the saturated liquid and vapor phases,
which can be provided with calls to PROPS_PH, PROPS_PS, or PROPS_PSATX.

     Subroutine PROPS_PT returns single-phase fluid properties as a function of Pressure and
Temperature. It does not return saturation properties. The calling statement for PROPS_PT is:

         CALL PROPS_PT(I_NFLUID, Z_P, Z_T, Z_RHO, Z_H, Z_CP, Z_CV,
            + Z_S, Z_GAMMA, Z_MU, Z_K, I_KR, Z_XV)

Input:
         I_NFLUID – Integer ID Number of the Fluid
         Z_P – Pressure
         Z_T – Temperature

Output:
      Z_RHO – Density
      Z_H – Enthalpy
      Z_CP – Specific heat at constant pressure
      Z_CV – Specific heat at constant volume
      Z_S – Entropy
      Z_GAMMA – Ratio of specific heats
      Z_MU – Viscosity
      Z_K – Thermal conductivity
      I_KR – Integer code for the fluid phase (0, unknown; 1, saturated; 2, liquid; 3, gas)
      Z_XV – Quality (vapor mass fraction)

      The units of the input and output properties are the same as GFSSP’s internal units, and are
shown in table 10. Table 11 gives the fluid ID numbers that are recognized by the PROPS subroutines.
An incorrect ID number will generate an error message and stop the run.

        Subroutine PROPS_PH returns fluid properties as a function of pressure and enthalpy. The
calling statement for PROPS_PH is:

         CALL PROPS_PH(I_NFLUID, Z_P, Z_T, Z_RHO, Z_H, Z_CP, Z_CV,
            + Z_S, Z_GAMMA, Z_MU, Z_K, I_KR, Z_XV,
            + Z_RHOL, Z_HL, Z_CPL, Z_CVL, Z_SL, Z_GAMMAL, Z_MUL, Z_KL,
            + Z_RHOV, Z_HV, Z_CPV, Z_CVV, Z_SV, Z_GAMMAV, Z_MUV, Z_KV)

Input:
         I_NFLUID – Integer ID number of the fluid
         Z_P – Pressure
         Z_H – Enthalpy

Output:
        The output is similar to the output of PROPS_PT, except that there are additional liquid (suf-
fix L) and vapor (suffix V) property values returned when the fluid is saturated. If the input enthalpy
falls under the saturation dome at the given pressure, variable I_KR will be returned as 1 (saturated),


                                                                                                             79
and the properties will be those of a homogeneous two-phase mixture with a quality of Z_XV. If the
fluid is single phase at the given pressure and enthalpy, variable I_KR will be returned as 2 (liquid)
or 3 (gas), and the saturated liquid and vapor property values will be zero.

        Subroutine PROPS_PS returns fluid properties as a function of pressure and entropy. The
calling statement for PROPS_PS is:

         CALL PROPS_PS(I_NFLUID, Z_P, Z_T, Z_RHO, Z_H, Z_CP, Z_CV,
            + Z_S, Z_GAMMA, Z_MU, Z_K, I_KR, Z_XV,
            + Z_RHOL, Z_HL, Z_CPL, Z_CVL, Z_SL, Z_GAMMAL, Z_MUL, Z_KL,
            + Z_RHOV, Z_HV, Z_CPV, Z_CVV, Z_SV, Z_GAMMAV, Z_MUV, Z_KV)

Input:
         I_NFLUID – Integer ID Number of the Fluid
         Z_P – Pressure
         Z_S – Entropy

Output:
        The output and saturation functionality is similar to that of PROPS_PH. The RP-1 and user
fluid interpolation table subroutines do not work as functions of entropy, so calls to PROPS_PS for
these fluids will generate an error message and stop the run.

        Subroutine PROPS_PSATX returns fluid properties at a given saturation pressure and qual-
ity (vapor mass fraction). The calling statement for PROPS_PSATX is:

         CALL PROPS_PSATX(I_NFLUID, Z_P, Z_T, Z_RHO, Z_H, Z_CP, Z_CV,
            + Z_S, Z_GAMMA, Z_MU, Z_K, I_KR, Z_XV,
            + Z_RHOL, Z_HL, Z_CPL, Z_CVL, Z_SL, Z_GAMMAL, Z_MUL, Z_KL,
            + Z_RHOV, Z_HV, Z_CPV, Z_CVV, Z_SV, Z_GAMMAV, Z_MUV, Z_KV)

Input:
         I_NFLUID – Integer ID Number of the Fluid
         Z_P – Saturation Pressure
         Z_XV – Quality (vapor mass fraction)

Output:
       The output is similar to the saturated output from PROPS_PH and PROPS_PS. If the user
only desires the liquid (suffix L) and vapor (suffix V) properties, an input Quality of zero may be
used, and the quality-weighted properties ignored. At this time, this subroutine only works for
GASP/WASP fluids; calls with RP-1 or user fluids will generate an error message and stop the run.
Providing a saturation pressure greater than the critical pressure will also generate an error message
and stop the run. Critical pressures for the GASP/WASP fluids are listed in table 11.

                              5. GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE


        This section introduces the visual thermofluid dynamics analyzer for systems and components
(VTASC), a unique GUI designed to simplify the model building process for GFSSP. VTASC allows
the user to design GFSSP models using an interactive ‘point and click’ paradigm. The program seeks
to eliminate some of the more tedious, error prone, and time-consuming operations associated with
the model building process such as the selection of unique numbers for nodes and branches, and the
explicit specification of the upstream and downstream nodes for every branch. The models may be
easily modified both in terms of additional nodes and branches and the model-specific data. Figure 46
shows the main VTASC window that consists of menu and toolbar options and a blank canvas.




                                 Figure 46. Main VTASC window.

                                                5.1 Menus

5.1.1 File Menu

         The File pulldown menu, shown in figure 47, contains the functions to begin a new model,
open an existing model, save the model, save the model with an alternate location and name, print
the model to a printer, print an image of the model to a bitmap (.bmp extension) file, write an input
file for GFSSP based on the current model, import a second model into an existing model, and exit
the application. The most commonly used of these functions are available, as shortcuts, from the file
input/output toolbar. In addition, the File menu contains a listing of the nine most recently saved
models.




                                                                                                    !

                                     Figure 47. VTASC File menu.


        The new model function will reinitialize the application to a clean state without having to exit
and then restart the application; if model data are present, then the user will be prompted to continue
the operation. The open model function will present a file dialog to allow the user to select a previous
model; note that all model files have a ‘.vts’ extension. The VTASC model files are not synonymous
with the GFSSP input files; GFSSP compatible input files may be generated, based on the current
model, as described below. The Save function allows the user to save the current model to a desired
location. In the case where the model has not been previously read or saved, a file dialog will appear
and allow the user to save the current model to a given location. The Save As function works identi-
cally except that a file dialog will appear in all instances. The Print function produces a Postscript file,
which allows the user to print the current circuit to a printer or to a file. The Print Image function
will save an image of the circuit in a bitmap file. The Write GFSSP file function will become active


82

once the user has input the required data; this is covered in the following section. The Import Model
function allows the user to insert additional models to an existing model. This function will become
active once the user has created a branch. The Save and Print functions are not available until at least
one node is present.

5.1.2 Edit Menu

       The Edit pulldown menu, shown in figure 48, contains the functions to delete a selected
item(s), activate the Global Options dialog, open an existing GFSSP output or input file using the
desired editor (see Global Options User Information tab, fig. 51c), and to select all elements on the
canvas. The Delete function, which is not available until at least one node is present, also appears
as a shortcut from the file input/output toolbar. The Global Options dialog is discussed in detail in
section 5.2.




                                                                 !
                                    Figure 48. VTASC Edit menu.


5.1.3 Advanced Menu

        The Advanced pulldown menu, shown in figure 49, contains the functions to activate dia-
logs for GFSSP’s Advanced options such as Transient Heat, Heat Exchanger, Tank Pressurization,
Turbopump, Valve Open/Close, Fluid Conduction (not active), Pressure Regulator, Flow Regula-
tor, Pressure Relief Valve, Enable/Disable Grid Generation, Enable/Disable Conjugate Heat Trans-
fer, and Select/Deselect SI Units. With the exception of Enable/Disable Grid Generation, Enable/
Disable Conjugate Heat Transfer, and Select/Deselect SI Units, these functions are not available
unless the Advanced option has been activated through the Global Options dialog. The Advanced
option dialogs are discussed in detail in section 5.4. Selecting Enable Grid Generation enables the
grid node on the left side of the main window. Selecting Enable Conjugate Heat Transfer will enable
the three Conjugate Heat Transfer related icons on the left side of the main window. Selecting Enable
SI Units will change all of the VTASC data input field labels to SI units.




                                                                                                     83

5.1.4 Run and Module Menus

       The Run pulldown menu contains the functions to call and run GFSSP, Winplot, and GFSSP
and Winplot together. These functions also appear as shortcuts from the file input/output toolbar.
The third function will call Winplot and then start GFSSP. Note that Winplot is not part of the
GFSSP installation package and must be obtained separately. Also note that Winplot is not made
available by VTASC unless a model is defined as an unsteady model. The Module menu contains the
function to activate the User Executable Build dialog. The User Executable Build dialog is discussed
in detail in section 5.6.

5.1.5 Display, Canvas, Group, and Help Menus

        The Display pulldown menu contains the functions to activate the Display Results/Proper-
ties dialog, clear any results/properties displayed on the canvas, and enable Quicklook. The Display
Results/Properties dialog is discussed in detail in section 5.9.3. The Canvas pulldown menu contains
the functions to toggle between a 1-, 2-, or 4-page canvas. The double page canvas configuration is
useful for larger models that will not easily fit on a single page canvas. Note that in multiple page con-
figurations, the user should allow for margins for printing. The Group pulldown menu provides the
ability to perform move/align operations on a group of network objects that have been selected. The
Help pulldown menu contains the function to activate a popup window with additional information
about that particular version of VTASC, open the GFSSP User Manual, and disable/enable tooltips.

5.2.1 General Information

        Selecting the General Information item, or toolbar alternative           , displays the following
dialog (fig. 51) to access User Information, Solution Control, and Output Control. The User Infor-
mation tab shown in figure 51(a) allows specification of the title, name of the analyst, working direc-
tory, GFSSP compatible input file, the output file to be generated by GFSSP, and the name and
location of the GFSSP executable that will be used to run the model. The working directory, which
is the directory where VTASC will write the GFSSP input and output files associated with the model,
is assigned by specifying a file path for the GFSSP input file. The installation version of GFSSP is the
default executable defined for any new model. Note that the file menu option Write GFSSP file will
become active only when the input and output GFSSP files have been specified. The Compiler radio
button allows the user to select either Compaq or Intel Fortran to compile user subroutines. The
default text editor for input, output, and history files is Notepad. The user may switch to another
editor (e.g., Textpad) by browsing to the executable in the Editor box.

        The Solution Control tab shown in figure 51(b) allows specification of certain characteristics
of the solution procedure of a particular model. The user can choose either a Simultaneous Solution
procedure or the original Hybrid Solution scheme. The user can also choose between the First Law
and Second Law of thermodynamics based solution procedures for the energy equation. For the
solid energy equation, the user can select either a Newton Raphson or Successive Substitution solu-
tion scheme. For the differencing scheme, the user may select either the First Order or Second Order.
For the Nonlinear Solver, the user may select either the Newton-Successive Substitution or Broyden-
Successive Substitution method. In addition, the user can specify the Convergence Criteria, Maxi-
mum Iterations, Relaxation parameters, and choose the method by which the initial guess is made.
The user can also specify if they wish to use restart files by checking the appropriate box. Checking
the Save Information box indicates the user wishes to save the final solution to use as an initial guess
in another model. Checking the Read Information box indicates the user wishes to read in a previ-
ously saved solution as an initial guess. Note that if both boxes are checked, GFSSP will overwrite
the initial restart files during the simulation. Two restart files are used by GFSSP for both saving and
reading information. One file is used for node information and one for branch information. The user
may name the restart files using the designated text boxes.

        The Output Control tab shown in figure 51(c) allows specification of the type of data to
output during the GFSSP simulation as well as requesting certain values to be checked for reason-
ableness, and requesting various messages for model debugging purposes. The solution check can be
activated by choosing Check Values. The output options consist of inclusion (default) or suppression
of: (1) Network Information (print), (2) Extended Thermodynamic and Thermophysical Informa-
tion at the nodes (print/plot), (3) Initial Flow Field (print), and (4) Winplot data (plot). For Winplot
data, the user can define whether and how often GFSSP writes output to the Winplot data files
(the default is 1, which writes output at every time step) as well as the type of file that is generated
(comma separated value files or a binary file formatted for the Winplot plot program). If Binary file
is selected, the user may select the number of plot records to buffer for each write to the binary file.
The Buffer entry (default 1.1) is a way to give allowance for possible increase in the data (decrease in
time step) to be written. Checking CSV will cause GFSSP to write a comma-separated variables file,
which can be processed by Excel.

       GFSSP provides a way for a user to define variables to be plotted. User-defined variables are
defined in one of the subroutines in the User Subroutine file, found in the installation folder. Check-
ing Tecplot Data will cause GFSSP to write data to a file that is suitable for input into the Tecplot
program.

       Checking Disable GFSSP Run Information will stop GFSSP from writing back to VTASC
in the GFSSP Run Dialog. This has been found to be helpful for long-running models. GFSSP will
create <modelname>.PLT files, which provide output data that can be used to present results within
VTASC. Disabling (default) will prevent these files from being created.

       Note that the Apply or Apply-Close button must be pressed to accept modifications to the data
in any of the tabs. To reset the data to default on all three tabs press Default and then the Accept
buttons. The Cancel button closes the General Information item without accepting any changes.

5.2.2 Circuit Options

        Selecting the Circuit Options item, or toolbar alternative        , displays the pane in figure 52,
allowing access to Circuit Options and Initial Values. The Circuit tab shown in figure 52(a) allows
specification of the options that will be activated for this circuit. These options include: Axial Thrust;
Cyclic Boundary; Dalton’s Law (only active for multiple fluid models); Enthalpy Formulation (Stag-
nation or Static); Fluid Conduction (activates Fluid Conduction on Advanced Menu, but is not
active); Fluid Mass Injection; Gravity (enables Buoyancy and Reference Node); Heat Exchanger
(activates Heat Exchanger Advanced Menu); Heat Source (with optional units); Inertia (Note that
while this option allows you to choose to supply relative angles between adjacent branches, no
mechanism currently exists to define those angles using VTASC. The user must manually edit the
GFSSP input file to supply those angles (also discussed in sec. 5.5.13)); Mixture (with option to
select method of calculations); MD-Grid; Momentum Source; Moving Boundary; Normal Stress;
Phase Separation Model; Rotation; Shear; Solid-Fluid Heat Transfer Coefficient with the ability to
choose method of calculation (only active for models using conjugate heat transfer); Transient Term
Active; Transverse Momentum; and Turbopump (activates Turbopump Advanced Menu). Note that
activating these options may require additional inputs in other areas of VTASC.

       The Initial Values tab shown in figure 52(b) allows the user to set initial values of Pressure,
Temperature, etc., for both boundary and interior nodes as well as solid nodes. The initial value
for nodes may be changed, after the model has been built, by modifying the desired data and pressing
the Apply to All button or the Apply to Selected button. For multiple fluids, the option to set default
concentrations will become visible. Node ID Sequence Start gives the user the ability to specify the
starting Node ID. This may be changed at any time during model creation.

5.2.3 Unsteady Options

        Selecting the Unsteady Options item, or toolbar alternative       , displays the dialog shown
in figure 53. The Unsteady Options dialog allows users to choose from various levels of unsteady
modeling. The options in this window include: Steady (default); Quasi-Steady; Time Step; Start
Time (a relative time­—does not have to be zero); Final Time; Print Frequency (controls print interval
to all output files except Winplot files); Unsteady; Variable Rotation (user specifies variable rota-
tion file name); Variable Geometry (user specifies the variable geometry file name); Variable Heat
Load (activates Transient Heat Advanced Menu); Tank Pressurization (activates Tank Pressuriza-
tion Advanced Menu); Valve Open/Close (activates Valve Open/Close Advanced Menu); Pressure
Regulator (activates Pressure Regulator on Advanced Menu); Flow Regulator (activates Flow Regu-
lator on Advanced Menu); and Pressure Relief Valve (activates Pressure Relief Valve on Advanced
Menu). Note that Pressure Regulator Option 1 and Flow Regulator Option 1 are mutually exclusive
in a circuit. Note that activating the unsteady options may require additional inputs in other areas of
VTASC.

5.2.4 Fluid Options

        Finally, selecting the Fluid Options item, or toolbar alternative         , displays the dialog
shown in figure 54. The Fluid Options dialog allows users to choose the thermodynamic property
approach used in the model. The user can choose from the embedded thermodynamic property
packages (1) GASP and WASP or (2) GASPAK. Additionally, the user can choose a constant density
fluid (the energy equation is not calculated with this option and this option cannot be used with fully
unsteady modeling); an ideal gas by specifying the fluid gas constant, specific heat, viscosity, thermal
conductivity, reference pressure, reference temperature, reference enthalpy, and reference entropy;
hydrogen peroxide, with the capability to define the mole fraction of water present in the fluid; and
user-defined fluids through user-defined property files. Note that choosing the constant density fluid
option causes the program to set the flow to steady and all unsteady options to be turned off.

        Desired fluids from the Library of Fluids may be selected and added to the Selected Fluids
list by pressing the     button. Fluids may be deleted from the Selected Fluids list by selecting the
unwanted fluids and pressing the      button. Note that a number enclosed in parentheses appears by
each selected fluid. This is the GFSSP index number for that fluid. If a user fluid is selected, VTASC
will prompt the user to double-click the fluid name to supply the fluid property file names and fluid

molecular weight. Note that all user-defined property files must reside in the model’s working direc-
tory. The Switch Package button allows the user to switch between the two available thermodynamic
property packages. The Switch Package button will only work when all selected fluids are common
to both fluid libraries. Note that manually switching between the two thermodynamic property pack-
ages will delete all fluids from the selected fluids list and node properties.

        5.2.4.1 Saturation Property Calculation for User-Specified Fluid. GFSSP has the capability
to define a User Fluid with property interpolation tables. These tables provide seven fluid properties
as functions of pressure and temperature. Beginning with v605, saturated fluid properties and phase
change may be modeled with a User Fluid, provided that an eighth table of saturation properties is
also supplied. A maximum of three User Fluids is permitted in a model.

       Figure 55 shows the VTASC fluid options dialog as set up to define water as a User Fluid.
The seven property filenames and fluid molecular weight must be provided. The eighth file providing

         The format of the seven property tables is:

P(NP), PROP(NP,1), PROP(NP,2), PROP(NP,3),…, PROP(NP,NT)

NP is the number of pressures and NT is the number of temperatures. There can be a maximum of
301 pressures and 301 temperatures in the property file. The pressures and temperatures must be the
same in all seven files. Figure 56 shows a portion of the density file for water.

       The format of the optional eighth property file for saturation properties is:

NPSAT
PSAT(1), TSAT, (H, ρ, Cp, μ, γ, k, S)LIQ, (H, ρ, Cp, μ, γ, K, S)VAP
PSAT(2), TSAT, (H, ρ, Cp, μ, γ, k, S)LIQ, (H, ρ, Cp, μ, γ, K, S)VAP
…
PSAT(NPSAT), TSAT, (H, ρ, Cp, μ, γ, k, S)LIQ, (H, ρ, Cp, μ, γ, K, S)VAP

NPSAT is the number of saturation pressures; the maximum is 500. The saturation pressures do not
need to be the same as the pressures in the seven property tables. Each line gives a saturation pres-
sure, the corresponding saturation temperature, and the seven properties of the saturated liquid and
saturated vapor. Figure 57 shows a portion of the saturated property file for water.

       A common source of fluid properties is the REFPROP program. Utility programs with
instructions (app. F) for converting output from REFPROP into GFSSP’s User Fluid format are
provided in the User Fluid Utilities subfolder of the GFSSP installation folder.

       General guidelines for developing user fluid tables:

• Interpolation is linear with respect to pressure and temperature. Many pressure points are recom-
  mended for compressible fluids to ensure accuracy of density interpolation.

• User fluids cannot be used with the Second Law energy equation, so entropy is a printout variable
  only. If entropy is unknown, the user may place dummy values in the table.

• If viscosity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity are not known as functions of pressure and/or
  temperature, the user may use the same constant value at all pressure and/or temperature points in
  the table.

• If enthalpy is not known, the user may construct enthalpy tables by integrating the specific heat
  over temperature.

                                            5.3 Fluid Circuit Design

5.3.1 Boundary and Internal Node Properties

       The boundary node addition tool           located on the left border of VTASC is used to place
boundary nodes on the drawing area, henceforth called the canvas. Upon selection of this tool the
user may add boundary nodes by moving the mouse to the canvas and pressing the left mouse but-
ton. Placing a node will activate the delete function in the toolbar, edit menu, or by typing CTRL+D.
Similarly, interior nodes may be added by selecting the interior node addition tool       . Note that the
nodes are automatically given unique numeric identifiers. Figure 58 shows a canvas with a number of
boundary and interior nodes.

        The selection tool      is used to select the desired node and either modify its location or
enable its deletion. Positioning the mouse and pressing the left button performs the selection; upon
selection, the selected node will be shown with a red border. Repositioning a node is simply per-
formed by pressing and holding the left mouse button over a node, moving the mouse to the desired
location, and releasing the left mouse button. Multiple nodes may be selected for deletion by using
the Ctrl keyboard button in conjunction with the mouse. The nodes may then be deleted using the
Delete toolbar button as long as they are not attached to any branches. A left mouse click within the
canvas, away from any nodes, will deselect any previously selected nodes.

        A right mouse click upon a node will select the node and present a popup menu (fig. 59)
allowing the user to delete the node (will not work on multiple node selections and is not avail-
able if the node is connected to any branch), set the properties for the indicated node, save the
node properties to a node property buffer, get the properties from the node property, or align the
node either horizontally or vertically with its neighboring elements. (Horizontal alignment aligns
all elements to the right of the selected node, while vertical alignment aligns all elements below
the selected node.) Once a model has been run, the internal node popup menu also allows the user
to activate the results dialogs, which will be discussed in section 5.8.

        Choosing the Properties … option will present the dialog shown in figure 60. The appropriate
inputs will be activated dependent upon the choices present within the Global Options dialog and
the type of the selected node, whether boundary or interior. The user may modify the desired data
within this dialog. To modify the concentration of a given fluid, select the desired fluid and type in
the desired concentration. Note that directly upon selecting a fluid, the user may type without hav-
ing to reposition the mouse. If the user wants to change the numeric identifier for a node, simply
type in the desired numeric identifier (maximum of five numbers). The user may enter any desired
descriptive text into the Node Description input box. Pressing the OK button will accept and adjust
the revised data and the Cancel button will reject the revised data. Also, in the case of an unsteady
flow, each boundary node will be automatically assigned a unique Node History File name that is
subject to user modification. Checkboxes allow for selection of the node as Moving Boundary, Phase
Separation Model, or Cyclic Boundary. These are enabled on Circuit Options.

5.3.2 Branch Properties

        The branch addition tool      is used to specify the branches between the nodes. Selection of
this tool immediately causes each interior and boundary node to be drawn with a series of ‘handles’
as denoted by the green squares in figure 61.



                                          2                        4

        The handles serve to clearly identify eight possible locations on a node where the initial
(upstream) or terminal (downstream) points of a branch may be located. Note that an unlimited num-
ber of branches may initiate or terminate at each handle. There are two different types of branches
that may be created—a directed line segment between any two nodes and two possibly discontinuous
line segments. In either case, a left mouse button click on a handle will initiate a branch. Once an
initial handle (specifies the upstream node) has been selected, further movement of the mouse will
draw a directed line segment from that handle to the current location of the mouse, as shown in fig-
ure 62(a). For the first type of branch, selecting another handle completes the branch, as this second
handle effectively specifies the downstream node (fig. 62(b)).

       The second type of branch is initiated identically; however, after selecting an initial handle, an
additional anchor point may be set at any location on the canvas by a left mouse click at the desired
location. The branch is then completed, as usual, by selecting another handle. This series of steps is
shown in figures 63(a) and (b).

         Completing a branch will activate the delete function in the toolbar, edit menu, or by typing
Ctrl+D. As shown in figures 62(b) and 63(b), a unique numeric branch identifier formed by concatenat-
ing adjacent node numbers is automatically generated and the directed arrowhead visually defines the
branch upstream and downstream node relationship. A click on the branch addition tool               may be
used to clear a branch currently under design and reinitialize the process. The selection tool         may
be used to select the desired branch and either modify its location or enable its deletion. The Ctrl button
may be used in conjunction with the mouse to select multiple branches and nodes for deletion using the
Delete toolbar button. Note that a node can only be deleted using this method if all branches attached
to it are deleted as well. Figure 64 shows an example fluid circuit complete with nodes and branches.

steady flows. The available resistance options are discussed in section 3.1.7. To assign a resistance
option, left click on the desired component and click the Accept button. Figure 69 shows an example
where each of the branches has been assigned a resistance option. The user may change the resis-
tance option for a branch at any time without deleting the branch.

        A right mouse click on a branch where the resistance has been specified will present the popup
menu (fig. 65) with the Properties … option activated. Choosing the Properties … option will pres-
ent a dialog that is specifically tailored to receive input for that Resistance option. In all instances, the
properties specification dialogs behave in an identical fashion; however, the Fittings and Valves -
dialog is somewhat different and will be shown as an example. Choosing the Properties option for a fit-
ting and valve will present the dialog shown in figure 70. The user can input the desired data or use the
tree structure to the right to select a desired fitting or valve. Selection of a fitting or valve from the tree
will load its specific data into the fields to the left; these data may then be edited as desired. The Accept
button must be pressed to apply the data.

        In general, the following applies to every resistance option. If the user wants to change the numeric
identifier for a branch, simply type in the desired numeric identifier (maximum of five digits). For the
unsteady case, the initial flow rate may be specified, and depending upon the selected global options, the
Rotation, Momentum Source, and Inertia checkboxes may be active. Notice, in this case, that the Rotation
checkbox is active and has been selected. If Rotation has been checked and Accepted, a right mouse click
on the branch will present the popup menu with the Rotation/Momentum Source option active, and select-
ing this option will present the following dialog (fig. 71) to allow input of the relevant information.

       The solid node     , ambient node       , and conductor   addition tools are used to specify
the conjugate heat transfer portion of a GFSSP model. These tools are inactive until the user acti-
vates Conjugate Heat Transfer by selecting it from the Advanced menu. In practice, adding solid and

ambient nodes to the VTASC canvas is analogous to adding internal and boundary fluid nodes,
while adding conductors is an identical process to adding fluid resistance branches.

         A right mouse click on an ambient node reveals a popup menu identical to the fluid bound-
ary node popup menu shown in figure 59(a), while the Solid Node popup menu is similar to the
Fluid Internal Node popup menu shown in figure 59(b). The Properties dialog for a solid node is
shown in figure 72. For a solid node, all inputs are required at each node. A list of available materi-
als is shown at the right of the dialog. When the user left mouse clicks the desired material from the
list, the GFSSP index number for that material is automatically written to the Material input box.
The Ambient Node Properties dialog shown in figure 73 requires a temperature and, optionally,
a history file (unsteady) as a modeling input.

  List of Figures         Return to Menu



       The Conductors popup menu (fig. 74) is very similar to the Fluid Branch popup menu (fig. 65).
The only differences are that a Conductors option replaces the Components option; there is no need for
a Rotation/Momentum option, and the Change Branch Connection option is here named the Change
Conductor connection option. (The functionality is identical to the Change Branch Connection option).




                                Figure 74. Conductors popup menu.


       When the user first adds a conductor to the canvas, VTASC indicates that the conductor type
is undefined using this symbol      . The user defines the type of conductor by selecting the Conduc-
tors option from the conductor popup menu. This opens the Conductors dialog shown in figure 75.
The user must select the appropriate type of conductor and click the Accept button. Note that
VTASC will not allow the user to select a conductor type that is inconsistent with the types of nodes
attached to that particular conductor (e.g., a solid-ambient convection conductor type cannot be
applied to a conductor connecting two solid nodes). As with fluid resistance branches, once the con-
ductor type has been defined, the Properties option becomes active in the conductor popup menu.
Selecting the Properties option activates a Properties dialog where the user supplies characteristics
that are specific to that conductor type.

5.3.4 Import Model

        VTASC provides the ability to easily combine two or more models using the Import Model
function on the File menu (see fig. 47). Any two models (vts) can be combined in either order, with
few exceptions/limitations. The imported model node and branch locations will be maintained. User
information, solution control, and output control information will not be imported; only models with
General Fluid specified will be imported; fluid conduction (inactive), fluid mass injection, momen-
tum source, and normal stress will not be imported. Component ID conflicts will trigger a dialog
giving the user an opportunity to resolve the conflict. Any inconsistencies will generate informational
messages. Example 23 utilizes the file import feature.

                                       5.4 Advanced Options

        GFSSP contains many advanced features: Transient Heat Load, Heat Exchanger, Tank Pres-
surization, Turbopump, Valve Open/Close, Fluid Conduction (not active), Pressure Regulator, Flow
Regulator, and Pressure Relief Valve. If any or all of the advanced features are selected (via Cir-
cuit Options or Unsteady Options), the user can input the appropriate information by selecting the
option corresponding to the feature from the Advanced menu (see fig. 49).

        The dialogs for each of the advanced options operate in an identical fashion. The user may
add any number of components to that option by pressing the Add button. To modify the data for
a particular component, the user must select the component of interest, modify the data, and press the
Accept button. To delete a component, press the Delete button after a component has been selected.




                                                                                                  107

5.4.1 Transient Heat

       The Transient Heat Load option dialog is shown in figure 76. This option is activated from
the Circuit Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.3). The user provides the fluid
node where the heat load is applied and the name and location of a history file containing the heat
load as a function of time.




                           Figure 76. Transient Heat Load option dialog.


5.4.2 Heat Exchanger

        The Heat Exchanger option dialog is shown in figure 77. This option is activated from the Cir-
cuit Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.2). The user has the option of modeling
a Counter Flow or Parallel Flow heat exchanger. The user supplies the branch numbers that will be
identified as the Hot and Cold Branches as well as a value for Heat Exchanger Effectiveness. If the
user enters a Heat Exchanger Effectiveness value between 0 and 1, GFSSP will perform calculations
based on that effectiveness. If the user enters a value >1, this prompts GFSSP to internally calculate
the effectiveness. In the latter case, the user must also supply a value of UA (the product of the over-
all conductance for heat transfer and the surface area on which that conductance is based).

5.4.3 Tank Pressurization

        The Tank Pressurization option dialog is shown in figure 78. This option is activated from
the Unsteady Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.4). The user has the option of
modeling a vertically oriented cylindrical tank or a spherical tank. The user identifies the fluid nodes
and fluid resistance branches in the model that represent the tank’s ullage and propellant. The user
is also asked to provide the initial surface areas where the ullage is interacting with (1) the propel-
lant and (2) the tank wall. The user must also supply relevant tank characteristics (density, specific
heat, and thermal conductivity of the tank wall material; tank wall thickness; and initial tank wall
temperature). Finally, VTASC provides default values for the constants used in GFSSP’s tank pres-
surization heat transfer calculations, but the user may modify these constants through this dialog if
desired.

        The Turbopump option dialog is shown in figure 79. This option is activated from the Cir-
cuit Options pane on the Global Options menu (see fig. 52(a)). The user supplies the fluid resistance
branches that will represent the pump and the turbine. The user also supplies some characteristics of
the turbine (speed, efficiency, diameter, and design point velocity ratio) as well as the name and loca-
tion of a history file containing the pump characteristics (the quantities (Head/Speed2) and (Torque/
(Density*Speed2)) as a function of (flow rate/speed).

        The Valve Open/Close option dialog is shown in figure 80. This option is activated from the
Unsteady Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.4). The user provides the fluid
resistance branch that represents the valve and the name and location of a history file containing the
cross-sectional flow area of the valve as a function of time.

5.4.6 Fluid Conduction (Not Active)

        The Fluid Conduction option dialog is shown in figure 81. This option is activated from the
Circuit Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.2). The user may populate the list
of internal nodes in two ways. First, left mouse clicking the Load Nodes button will automatically
populate the list with each internal node. Second, an individual internal node may be added to the
list by typing the node identifier into the New Node input box and left mouse clicking the Add
button. If the user wants to remove an internal node from the list, select that node from the list and
left mouse click the Delete button. Selecting an internal node from the list reveals the list of upstream
and downstream neighbors for that node. The user supplies the Area and Distance for each neighbor
node by selecting that node from the Neighbor Nodes list.

5.4.7 Pressure Regulator

        GFSSP offers a Pressure Regulator option to control the pressure downstream of a Restric-
tion or Compressible Orifice branch. The Pressure Regulator option dialog is shown in figure 82. This
option is activated from the Unsteady Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.4).
The user is given two options: Iterative algorithm (Option 1) or Forward-looking algorithm (Option
2). With the Iterative algorithm, at each time step, the regulator area is adjusted until the desired
pressure is achieved, or the maximum number of iterations is reached. This option behaves like an
instantly responding regulator. Note that the many iterations per time step may slow running of the
model and that only one Option 1 regulator is allowed per model. With the Forward-looking algo-
rithm, the regulator area is adjusted just once per time step, based on an empirical relation developed
by reference 27. This option may run faster, but the pressure may oscillate about the setpoint for
several time steps until convergence is reached. Multiple Option 2 regulators are allowed.

                                                   .




                                                                                              	  

                                Figure 82. Pressure Regulator dialog.


       The user may choose a constant required pressure, or define a pressure versus time profile in
a history file. The format of the history file is:
NLINES
TIME1 P1
TIME2 P2
Etc….

NLINES is the number of TIME and P pairs in the file. TIME is given in seconds. Pressure is given
in psia or kPa. The required pressure is then interpolated at each time step.

5.4.8 Flow Regulator

       GFSSP offers a Flow Regulator option (fig. 83) to control the flow rate through a designated
Restriction or Compressible Orifice branch. This option is activated from the Unsteady Options
pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.4).




                                  Figure 83. Flow Regulator dialog.


• Option 1—Iterative algorithm: In each time step, the regulator area is adjusted until the desired
  flow rate is achieved. This option acts like an instantly responding regulator. Note that the many
  iterations per time step may slow the model, and that only one regulator per model is allowed.

• Option 2—Marching algorithm: The regulator area is adjusted just once per time step. The area
  correction is based on the numerical derivative of flow rate versus area from the previous time steps.
  The flow rate may oscillate around the setpoint for several time steps until convergence is reached.
  Multiple regulators are allowed. Because other elements of the model may also affect the flow rate
  in the branch, the numerical derivative calculation is not exact, which may lead to improper area
  adjustment and an unstable model. Under-relaxation may improve the solution.

        The user may choose a constant required flow rate, or one that varies with time based on a his-
tory file. The format of the history file is:
NLINES
TIME1 F1
TIME2 F2,
…

where NLINES is the number of history points, TIME is the time in seconds, and F is the desired
flow rate in lb/s or kg/s.
                                                                                                    113

5.4.9 Pressure Relief Valve

        GFSSP allows the user to select a Restriction, Compressible Orifice, or Valve with Cv branch
as a pressure relief valve. This normally closed branch will monitor the pressure differential between
the upstream and downstream nodes, opening when the pressure differential exceeds a user-defined
cracking pressure. The Pressure Relief Valve option dialog is shown in figure 84. This option is acti-
vated from the Unsteady Options pane on the Global Options menu (see sec. 5.2.4).




                               Figure 84. Pressure Relief Valve dialog.


        Besides the cracking pressure (in psid or kPad), the user must supply a control file to describe
the relief valve’s operation. The format of the control file is:

NLINES
dP1 A or Cv1
dP2 A or Cv2
…
dPN A or CvN.

NLINES is the number of dP points in the file, and dP is the differential pressure across the valve, in
psid or kPad. If using a Restriction or Compressible Orifice, A should be the area in in^2 or m^2. If
using a Valve with Cv, Cv should be the value of Cv. The first pressure (dP1) is the reseating pressure,
and is associated with a very small area (e.g., 1.0E-16 in^2) or small Cv (e.g. 1.0E-5).The first pressure
should be less than or equal to the cracking pressure. The last point (dPN) is the pressure at which
the relief valve is fully open, and is associated with the fully open area/Cv. At pressures between the
reseating pressure and the fully open pressure, the area or Cv of the valve will be interpolated. At
pressures greater than the last point (dPN), the fully open area/Cv value is used.

5.4.10 Grid Generation

        GFSSP provides the capability to generate a two-dimensional grid using Cartesian (X,Y) or
Polar (R,Z) coordinates. After this feature is enabled on the Advanced Menu, the user selects the Grid
Node on the left side of the main window (fig. 46). Left-clicking on the canvas will place a Grid Node
on the canvas. This node is a placeholder substituting for the actual grid to be generated. Its properties
will be the parameters of the generated grid. The grid is generated by right clicking on the Grid Node
and selecting Generate Grid from the menu. This will produce the Grid Property dialog (see fig. 85),
which is used to generate a grid, review the grid properties, and regenerate a grid with new parameters.




                                  Figure 85. Grid Properties dialog.


        This dialog is used to specify the parameters of the two-dimensional grid: Cartesian or Polar,
Uniform or Nonuniform (requires seeds for X and Y distribution of nodes); direction of node sweep
(increasing first in the X-direction or increasing first in the Y-direction); whether boundary is a wall;
velocity at the boundary; angle of the wall with the coordinate direction at boundary, overall length
of the cavity, and number of nodes to distribute over that length; and default Pressure and Tempera-
ture for nodes.


                                                                                                      115

       When the grid generation is completed a message is displayed reminding that connectivity
must be established between the grid and system components. The grid is not initially displayed on
the canvas. It can be shown by right-clicking on the Grid Node and selecting Select Grid (fig. 86).
Node and branch properties can be reviewed, but not modified. Right-click on the canvas to hide the
grid. To establish connectivity between the generated grid and the system components, connect the
Grid Node with desired branch option (fig. 87). Right-click on that branch and select Resolve Grid
Node Connection. This will produce the dialog shown in figure 88. Click on the desired generated
node number, which will insert it into Connecting Node edit box, and click OK. The grid connecting
node will have a green border when the generated grid is displayed.

which will display the Grid Properties dialog. The grid can then be regenerated with new parameters by
entering new parameters and clicking on Regenerate Grid. This will delete the existing grid and system
connectivity, and create a new grid, which will need to be reconnected to the system components.

5.4.11 International Standard Units

       VTASC provides the user the option to use SI units to specify values for properties being
modeled. The SI values entered are converted to English units and written to the data file to be read
by GFSSP. GFSSP output will be converted into SI units for reports and plotting. For users who
use the User Subroutines, conversion (SI-English) functions are available to perform the unit
conver-sions. A listing of the functions is found in userrtn604.for in appendix E.




                                                                                                  117

                                        5.5 GFSSP Input File

       The primary interface between VTASC and GFSSP is the GFSSP input data file generated by
VTASC. While it should not be necessary for the user to directly access the GFSSP input file for most
modeling activities, knowledge of the content and format of the GFSSP input data file may be helpful
in some circumstances. This section is intended to provide the user with a helpful reference for better
understanding the GFSSP input data file.

5.5.1 Title Information

        The GFSSP input data file always begins with the title and documentary information for the
model, which are shown below. The first two entries are internally defined by VTASC. The first, the
GFSSP Version, tells GFSSP what features and formatting to expect while reading the input data file.
The second entry defines where the user has installed GFSSP. The user defines the remaining four
entries in VTASC. They include the analyst’s name, the working directory path and input data file
name, output data file name, and a descriptive title for the model.

5.5.8 Node Variables

       The next section of the GFSSP input data file lists the initial properties at each node based on
the user’s selections in VTASC.

        For a steady state model, the model boundary conditions are listed along with the internal
node initial guesses. Concentrations are listed at each node in the same order the fluids are listed
(see sec. 5.5.6). If the user has chosen the Constant Property Fluid option, the temperature will not
appear in this listing.

         For an unsteady model, the internal node initial solution values are listed first in the same
order they were created. These properties include the node volume property, which does not appear in
a steady state model. After all of the internal nodes have been listed, each boundary node history file
is listed (again, in the order they were created). Each boundary node requires a separate history file.

5.5.9 Transient Heat/Variable Geometry Information

       This section of the GFSSP input data file is applicable only for unsteady models where the
user has activated either the Transient Heat or Variable Geometry options.

       If the user has elected to use the Variable Geometry option, the variable geometry file name
will appear right below the last boundary node history file name. There is no description line associ-
ated with the variable geometry listing in the input data file.

        The transient heat section of the GFSSP input data file first lists the number of nodes iden-
tified by the user as having a transient heat load. Each identified node is then listed along with the
corresponding heat load file name in the order the user added their information in the Transient Heat
dialog (see sec. 5.4.1).

5.5.10 Node-Branch Connections

        The next section of the GFSSP input data file identifies which branches are attached to each
internal node. Each internal node (variable INODE) is listed in the same order they were created.
The variable NUMBR defines how many branches are attached to that node. The array NAMEBR
identifies which branches are attached to that node in the order they were created.

5.5.11 Branch Flow Designation and Resistance Options

       The next section of the GFSSP input data file describes the characteristics of each fluid branch.
This section consists of two subsections. The first subsection identifies the upstream node, down-
stream node, and branch resistance option chosen by the user. This subsection also includes any text
description of that branch supplied by the user.

BRANCH    UPNODE     DNNODE     OPTION     DESCRIPTION

5.5.13 Inertia Information

        This section of the GFSSP input data file is applicable only for models where the user has
activated the Inertia option. This section is divided into four subsections. The first subsection defines
a fluid branch’s relationship with any upstream branches. Branches are listed in the order they were
created. The variable NOUBR defines the number of upstream branches connected to a particular
branch. The array NMUBR identifies which branches are attached upstream of that branch in the
order they were created. The second subsection defines a fluid branch’s relationship with any down-
stream branches. Each branch is listed in the order they were created. The variable NODBR defines
the number of downstream branches connected to a particular branch. The array NMDBR identi-
fies which branches are attached downstream of that branch in the order they were created.

BRANCH     NOUBR     NMUBR
12         0

       The third subsection allows the user to define relative angles between branches if desired.
As discussed in section 5.2.2, the user must edit this section of the input data file manually. VTASC
supplies a template for each branch in the order they were created. The template lists each upstream
branch and corresponding angle first, then each downstream branch and corresponding angle.
VTASC defines each angle as a placeholder value of zero degrees, which the user must replace with
the appropriate angles.

5.5.14 Fluid Conduction Information (Not Active)

       This section of the GFSSP input data file is applicable only for models where the user has
activated the Fluid Conduction option. This section is divided into two subsections. The first sub-
section identifies how many fluid conduction nodes the user has selected. For each of these fluid
nodes, the number of upstream and downstream nodes connected to that node (identified here
as neighbors) is defined and each neighbor node is listed.

        The second subsection defines the fluid conduction properties (area and internode dis-
tance) for the interaction between a particular node and each of its neighbors. For each node, the
property of interest between that node and each neighbor is listed in the order the neighbor nodes
are listed in the first subsection.

                                         5.6 User Executable

        Advanced users may wish to take advantage of the User Subroutines to model physics not
directly available in VTASC. In order to do this, the user will need access to a FORTRAN com-
piler so that a specialized GFSSP executable may be created. If the user has the Compaq Visual
FORTRAN compiler or Intel FORTRAN compiler installed on their computer, they can create
a user executable through the Build dialog (activated from the Module menu).

        Figure 89 shows the Build dialog. The user supplies the User Subroutine file name and loca-
tion (if other than the model’s working directory). The user may browse to find the appropriate User
Subroutine file and can edit the file using the buttons at the right of the User Module File text box.
VTASC will automatically identify the default GFSSP, GASPAK, and GASP Object File names and
locations based on the user’s GFSSP installation directory. If for some reason, the user wishes to use
some other object file versions, they may browse to the desired object file locations using the but-
tons at the right of each text box. When the user clicks the Build button, VTASC uses the Compaq
Visual FORTRAN or Intel compiler to create a specialized user executable. The interaction between
VTASC and the compiler is shown to the user with the display pane on the Build dialog. Any com-
pilation errors or warnings will appear on the display pane. If the user wishes to stop the build pro-
cess for any reason, clicking the Stop button will cancel the build session. If the build is successful,
a specialized GFSSP executable named after the User Subroutine is created and saved to the model’s
working directory. Also, the user executable filename is automatically saved as the GFSSP executable
filename on the User Information tab of the General Information item of the Options menu (see
sec. 5.2.1). The Close button will exit the Build dialog and return the user to the VTASC window.

                                       5.7 GFSSP Execution

       As noted in section 5.1.4, GFSSP can be executed directly from the VTASC environment
using either the Run menu or the shortcut on the file Input/Output toolbar. When the user activates
the Run GFSSP command, VTASC automatically writes the GFSSP text input file before executing
GFSSP. If the text file already exists, VTASC will ask if the user wishes to overwrite the file. VTASC
then executes GFSSP and opens the GFSSP Run Manager window. The appearance and function of
the Run Manager depends on whether the model is a steady state or transient model.




                                                                                                  131

5.7.1 Steady State Run Manager

       Figure 90 shows the GFSSP Run Manager appearance for a steady state simulation. If the
user wishes to stop the GFSSP simulation for any reason, the button in the upper left corner of the
Run Manager will stop GFSSP execution. During execution, the Run Manager will display GFSSP-
generated messages in the GFSSP display pane. After execution is complete, the GFSSP messages
may be printed by clicking the Print button in the lower right corner of the Run Manager. The
GFSSP-generated text output file may also be viewed after execution is complete by clicking the Edit
Output button in the lower left corner of the Run Manager. Clicking the Close button will exit the
Run Manager and return the user to the VTASC window.

difference between the unsteady and steady Run Managers is that the GFSSP display pane appears

as a function of time appears in the bottom half of the Run Manager. See General Information,

                                         5.8 GFSSP Output File

        The basic GFSSP output for any simulation is the text output file. As mentioned in the previ-
ous section, once a simulation is complete the Run Manager gives the user the option of viewing the
output file in a text editor. The content of the output file is dependent on the options selected by the
user during VTASC model development. This section is intended to give the user an understanding
of the format and general layout of the text output file.

5.8.1 Title and Data Files

      Each GFSSP output file begins with the header shown below, which identifies the version
of GFSSP that was used for the model simulation.

5.8.9 Solution Results

       This section of the output file documents the solution results of the GFSSP model. If the
model is unsteady, a solution will be output at each time step the user has chosen to print (defined by
the Print Frequency as discussed in sec. 5.2.3). The first line in the solution will list the current time
step and the time at this step.

 ISTEP = 25          TAU = 0.25000E+02

        Next, the unsteady model will print out the boundary conditions at each boundary node for
that time step. The format is identical to that discussed in section 5.8.5.

        After this line, the solution will be output in the same format for a steady model or the time
step of interest in an unsteady model. For each internal node in a single fluid model, the calculated
pressure, temperature, compressibility, density, resident mass, and fluid quality are listed. The listing
is identical for a multiple fluid model except that the quality is replaced with the calculated mass con-
centration of each fluid at that node. For a constant property fluid model, only the calculated pres-
sure and resident mass are listed. Note that for a steady model, the resident mass will always be zero.

5.8.10 Convergence Information

        The final section of the output file contains information on the convergence of the solution. It
is important to remember that GASP/WASP allows extrapolation outside the stated limits of its fluid
property relationships. While this allows for flexibility during the iterative process, it can occasion-
ally lead to a final solution based on extrapolated properties. For models where the user has selected
GASP/WASP, GFSSP checks the pressure and temperature at each node and prints a warning in
the output file if they are outside of GASP/WASP’s stated limits so that the user can verify that the
results are reasonable.

WARNING! CHKGASP: T out of fluid property range at node              1

GFSSP also prints a statement indicating whether or not the solution converged. For an unsteady
model, this statement is printed at each time step. If the solution converges, the statement lists the
convergence criteria and the number of iterations needed to reach convergence.

        If the solution does not converge, the statement lists the convergence criteria, the number

       This section of the output file is only active if the user has selected to print the initial field
from the Global Options dialog (see sec. 5.2.1). The time and time step will be listed after the con-
vergence information. For a steady model, the time will read 100,000,000 s and the time step will be 1.

                                 5.9 Post-Processing Simulation Data

        While the GFSSP output file provides a comprehensive summary of model simulation results,
it is not always a practical source of information to meet the user’s needs. Therefore, VTASC pro-
vides alternative methods of viewing GFSSP output for both steady and unsteady simulations.

5.9.1 Steady State Simulation Results

       As mentioned in section 5.3, each GFSSP solution model element (fluid internal nodes and
branches, conjugate heat transfer solid nodes and conductors) has a Results… dialog option located
on their respective popup menus. After running a steady state simulation, if the user selects the
Results option for a particular element, a table of results at that location will be displayed.

        Figure 92 shows the internal fluid node results table for a steady state simulation with multiple
fluids. For this case, the table includes the calculated pressure, temperature, compressibility, density,
resident mass, and the mass concentration of each fluid at that node. The internal fluid node table
contents will vary just like the fluid node solution results discussed in section 5.8.9 based on the
user’s selections (multiple fluid, single fluid, constant property fluid, and print extended informa-
tion). Clicking the OK button will close the Results option and return the user to VTASC.

       The results tables for the fluid branches, solid nodes, and conductors are the same in appear-
ance and function as the internal fluid node table discussed above. The parameters that are listed
in each table are the same parameters discussed in section 5.8.9 for each respective element.

5.9.2 Unsteady Simulation Results

       There are two options available in VTASC for generating plots of unsteady simulations,
depending on the user’s needs: VTASC Plot and Winplot. There is also a provision of using Tecplot
for plotting two-dimensional flow field.

       5.9.2.1 VTASC Plot. The VTASC Plot is a built-in plotting capability within VTASC. As
with the steady state results tables, it is accessed by selecting the Results… dialog from the desired
model element’s popup menu. The appearance and function of VTASC Plot is the same for each
model element. The only difference will be the parameters available to plot, which are the same
parameters discussed for each element in section 5.8.9.

        Figure 93 shows the Results dialog for an unsteady simulation. Initially, the plot canvas space
will be blank. The user can generate a hard copy or a bitmap of the desired plot by clicking the Print
or Print to Bitmap button, respectively. The user creates the desired plot using the Properties dialog,
which is activated by clicking the Properties… button. Once the user has finished, clicking the Close
button will end the Results dialog and return the user to VTASC.

       Figure 94 shows the Properties dialog used to create a plot of unsteady results. The dialog
consists of three tabs, as well as Apply, OK, and Cancel buttons. Clicking the Apply button accepts
any changes that have been made. The OK button closes the Properties dialog and returns to the
Results dialog. The Cancel button fulfills the same function as the OK button.

        Data, the first tab (fig. 94(a)), allows the user to define the data they wish to plot. The user may
select parameters for plotting using the Data Selection list at the top of the tab. The user selects plot
parameters by highlighting the desired parameters in the Available Data list and clicking the        button.
These parameters will then be added to the Selected Data list. If the user wishes to remove parameters
from the Selected Data list, highlight those parameters and click the         button. Note that VTASC Plot
does not have Multi-Y axis plotting capability so scale should be considered when plotting multiple
parameters on a single plot. The Data Properties list at the bottom of the tab can be used to design
the line style of each plot parameter. The user highlights the parameter whose line style they wish to
design and then selects the line type, width, and color from the available selections on the right. Once
all changes have been made to a particular parameter, click the Apply button to accept the changes.

       Labeling, the second tab (fig. 94(b)), allows the user to define the Labeling parameters. Titles
may be written or modified for the X and Y axes as well as the overall plot. The user may select
whether or not they wish to include a grid or a legend on the plot by clicking the appropriate check-
box. The user may also define the number of minor tick marks they wish to see for each axis. Once
all changes have been made, click the Apply button to accept the changes.

        Scale, the third tab (fig. 94(c)), allows the user to modify the scale of each axis. By default,
VTASC will auto scale a plot for the user. Deselecting the Auto Scale checkbox allows the user to define
the minimum and maximum values for each axis. The user also has the option of converting the Y axis
to a log scale. Once all changes have been made, click the Apply button to accept the changes.

        5.9.2.2 Winplot. If the user selects the Winplot plotting option from the Global Options dia-
log (see sec. 5.2.1), unsteady plot files will be generated in either comma delimited or binary formats.
If the user selects the comma delimited option, several files are generated. The naming convention,
description, and available parameters for each file are listed in table 13. Note that the conjugate heat
transfer related output files are only written if a node or conductor of that type is present in the
model. If the user selects the binary format, a single file with the name convention ‘filename.WPL’
will be generated. This file will contain all of the available parameters for each model element as dis-
cussed in section 5.8.9 as well as DIFMAX, RSDMAX, and ITER.

        As mentioned in section 5.1.4, Winplot must be obtained separately by the user. If Winplot
is installed on the user’s computer, the user may open Winplot using the Run Menu’s Winplot selec-
tion or the Run Winplot button on the VTASC toolbar. If the unsteady plot files already exist, they
will automatically be loaded into Winplot. Otherwise, the user must reselect the Run Menu Winplot
selection or toolbar Winplot button to load the plot files into Winplot. For plotting and manipulat-
ing data in Winplot, the user is referred to the Winplot user’s manual.13

       5.9.2.3 Tecplot. There is a provision of representing two-dimensional flow field using
Tecplot—a commercial flow visualization software. For two-dimensional calculation, the user can
activate Tecplot Data in the Output Control window under General Information. This activation
allows GFSSP to create a Tecplot data file. After the completion of the run, the user can activate
Tecplot in the main window by left clicking the Run Tecplot button in the top line of the canvas.

5.9.3 Display in Flow Circuit

       An option exists within VTASC to display results for a particular model element on the
VTASC canvas itself. The user can then observe how certain solution parameters change as adjust-
ments are made to the model. This also allows the user to print the model with the results of interest
as a hard copy or bitmap for reports or presentations. The user activates this option by first selecting
the model element(s) using the selection tool. Then, as discussed in section 5.1.5, the user activates
the Display Results/Properties dialog from the Display menu. Figure 95 shows an example of dis-
playing the results on the VTASC canvas.

        Figure 96 shows the Display Results/Properties dialog. The user can select a maximum of
three different parameters to display for each model element. Note that display parameters cannot
be varied between like model elements (i.e., the user cannot display the pressure at one fluid node and
the temperature at another fluid node). The selected parameters are displayed at all selected elements
of that type. Also note that the conjugate heat transfer parameter selections are not active unless the
user has activated Conjugate Heat Transfer. Once the user has selected all desired display param-
eters, the Apply button is used to accept the changes. The OK button closes the Display Results/
Properties dialog and returns the user to VTASC. The Cancel button fulfills the same function as the
OK button.

                                          6. EXAMPLES


        This section demonstrates the major features of the code through 30 example problems,
selected to serve two purposes. First, these problems will instruct the user on how to use the various
options available in the code to analyze different fluid engineering problems. The other purpose of
the examples contained within this section is to verify the code’s predictions. This verification was
accomplished by comparing the GFSSP solutions with analytical solutions, other numerical solu-
tions, or with test data. The included demonstration problems are as follows:

        (1)   Simulation of a flow system consisting of a pump, valve, and pipe line.
        (2)   Simulation of a water distribution network.
        (3)   Simulation of compressible flow in a converging-diverging nozzle.
        (4)   Simulation of the mixing of combustion gases and a cold gas stream.
        (5)   Simulation of a flow system involving a heat exchanger.
        (6)   Radial flow on a rotating radial disk.
        (7)   Flow in a long-bearing squeeze film damper.
        (8)   Simulation of the blowdown of a pressurized tank.
        (9)   A reciprocating piston-cylinder.
       (10)   Pressurization of a propellant tank.
       (11)   Power balancing of a turbopump assembly.
       (12)   Helium pressurization of LOX and RP-1 propellant tanks.
       (13)   Steady state and transient conduction through a circular rod, with convection.
       (14)   Chilldown of a short cryogenic pipe line.
       (15)   Simulation of fluid transient following sudden valve closure.
       (16)   Simulation of pressure regulator downstream of a pressurized tank.
       (17)   Simulation of flow regulator downstream of a pressurized tank.
       (18)   Subsonic Fanno flow.
       (19)   Subsonic Rayleigh flow.
       (20)   Modeling of closed cycle liquid metal (lithium) loop with heat exchanger to heat helium
              gas.
       (21)   Internal flow in a turbopump.
       (22)   Simulation of a fluid network with fixed flow rate option.
       (23)   Helium-assisted, buoyancy-driven flow in a vertical pipe carrying LOX with ambient
              heat leak.
       (24)   Simulation of relief valve in a pressurized tank.
       (25)   Two-dimensional recirculating flow in a driven cavity.
       (26)   Fluid transients in pipes due to sudden opening of valve.
       (27)   Boiling water reactor.
       (28)   No-vent tank chill and fill model.
       (29)   Self-pressurization of a cryogenic propellant tank due to boil-off.
       (30)   Modeling solid propellant ballistic with GFSSP.

       The selection of the order for these problems is partly determined by their complexities and
partly due to the historical developments of new options and capabilities of the code. The first
seven problems consider steady state flows and use relatively simple flow networks. Each example
demonstrates use of a special option. Example 8 is a two-node model to demonstrate the use of the
unsteady option. More complex unsteady flow examples are illustrated in examples 9, 10, and 12.

        Options for time-dependent geometry and moving boundary are shown in example 9. Pres-
surization of a cryogenic propellant tank is described in example 10. This example also illustrates
the use of User Subroutines to calculate evaporation and mass transfer. The application of the Tur-
bopump and Heat Exchanger options in a typical gas turbine system is illustrated in example 11.
The use of a control valve in a pressurization system consisting of both fuel and oxidant tanks is
the highlight of example 12. Example 12 is the most complex example, using many options such
as mixture and inertia in unsteady flow. Examples 13 and 14 introduce GFSSP’s conjugate heat
transfer capability. Example 13 is an adaptation of a classical heat transfer problem into GFSSP, while
example 14 simulates a common conjugate heat transfer engineering application in cryogenic systems.
Example 15 emphasizes GFSSP’s ability to predict fluid transient phenomena. Examples 16 and 17
illustrate the use of pressure and flow regulator options which were included in version 6. Two clas-
sical problems on compressible flows (Fanno and Rayleigh flows) are described in examples 18 and
19. GFSSP solutions were compared with analytical solutions for both problems. Example 20 illus-
trates the modeling of a closed loop and the use of a property look-up table. The modeling of
internal flow in a turbopump with interpropellant seal for axial thrust calculation is illustrated in
example 21. The use of the fixed flow rate option is illustrated in example 22. The use of a new
mixture option that allows phase change is demonstrated in example 23. Example 24 demonstrates
the use of a pressure relief valve to allow flow out of a pressurized tank that has exceeded a defined
pressure. Use of the multidimensional option is demonstrated in example 25 by modeling recircu-
lating flow in a driven cavity. Table 14a (examples 1–15) and table 14b (examples 16–30) describe
a matrix of the example problems and their use of various options to model the necessary phys-
ical processes. Several technical papers illustrate the application of GFSSP in modeling internal
flow in rocket engine turbopump,28–30 propellant tank pressurization,31,32 chilldown of cryogenic
transfer line,33,34 propellant tank loading,35 propellant tank boil-off,36 fluid transient,27,37 pressure
regulator,38 and microfluidics application.39

      6.1 Example 1—Simulation of a Flow System Consisting of a Pump, Valve, and Pipe Line

6.1.1 Problem Considered

       A problem commonly encountered in fluid engineering is to match a pump’s characteristics
with the operating system’s characteristics. The designer needs to know the flow rate in the system
and the power consumed by the pump. The following example problem demonstrates how GFSSP
can be used to predict this information.

        The system considered for this example is shown in figure 98. It consists of two reservoirs
connected by 1,500 ft of 6-in-diameter pipe with a roughness factor (ε /D) of 0.005. The receiving
reservoir is located at an elevation that is 150 ft higher than the supply reservoir. The head-flow char-
acteristics of the pump considered in this problem are shown in figure 99. This pump should be used
to transport water, at 60 ºF, from the supply reservoir to the receiving reservoir. GFSSP will be used
to determine the system flow rate and required pump horsepower.


                                                                                                  Receiving Reservoir

6.1.2 GFSSP Model

        The fluid system shown in figure 98 can be simulated with a GFSSP model consisting of
four nodes and three branches as shown in figure 100(a). Nodes 1 and 4 are the boundary nodes
representing the supply and receiving reservoirs that are both at 14.7 psia and 60 ºF. Node 2 is an
internal node representing the pump exit and the inlet to the gate valve. Node 3 is an internal node
representing the exit from the gate valve and the inlet to the pipe line that connects the valve to the
receiving reservoir. Branches 12, 23, and 34 represent the pump, gate valve, and pipe line, respectively.
Figure 100(b) shows how this model appears in VTASC.

      Once the boundary conditions have been established, the next step is to obtain the necessary
information required to model the resistances and the momentum source located in the branches.

        6.1.2.1 Branch 12 (Pump). Option 14 was selected to represent the pump because this option
allows the user to model a pump with a given characteristics curve using either two or three con-
stants. For this problem, two constants, A0 and B0, were input as well as the pump area (area is only
required for the velocity calculation). These constants represent the slope and the intercept of the
m! 2 versus ∆p curve. The following procedure is used to obtain these constants:

      (1) Construct a table, based on user-selected points, from the pump characteristics curve
shown in figure 99 to develop a relationship between m! 2 and ∆p. These data are shown in table 15,
where m! = ρQ and ∆p =ρg/gc H.

        (2) Plot the ∆p and m! 2 data from table 15 as shown in figure 101. Note that the relationship
is linear (i.e., ∆p = A0 + B0 m! 2). Therefore, the pump characteristic curve can be prescribed with two
constants, A0 and B0, and the optional third constant is not necessary.

       (3) Determine the constants A0 and B0 from figure 101:

The intercept (∆p at m! 2 = 0) is A0 = 30,888.

      Since the curve is linear, the slope can be determined at any point without sacrificing accuracy.
In VTASC, A0 is entered in the intercept input box and B0 is entered in the second order input box.

         6.1.2.2 Branch 23 (Gate Valve). Option 13 was used to represent the gate valve. Option 13
requires two constants, K1 and K∞ (two-K method), and the internal diameter to model various pipe
fittings. The two required constants were obtained from table 7 (see sec. 3) assuming a reduced trim
(b = 0.8) gate valve.

       6.1.2.3 Branch 34 (Pipe Line). Option 1 was used to represent the pipe line. This branch resis-
tance option requires the user to supply the length, diameter, roughness factor (ε /D), and the angle
between the gravity vector and the pipe line.

6.1.3 Results

       The example 1 GFSSP input and output data files (ex1.dat and ex1.out) are
included in appendix H.

       The example 1 GFSSP model predicts a flow rate of 191 lb/s and the pressure rise across the
pump is 214 psi. Interpolation in the table 15 data shows that the pump pressure rise for the GFSSP
predicted flow rate is 213 psi, which indicates that the model is working as expected. This example
demonstrates that GFSSP can accurately predict the operating point of a fluid system consisting of
a pump and a pipe line with a valve.

        When selecting a pump, the mass flow rate in the attached fluid system is generally unknown.
By generating a system characteristic curve and plotting this curve against the pump characteristic
curve, the operating point of the system can be determined. Using the example 1 GFSSP model, the
system characteristic curve can be generated in the following manner:

       (1) Eliminate the pump by setting A0 and B0 to zero.
       (2) Set boundary pressures P1 and P4 to desired values.
       (3) Run the model.
       (4) Repeat steps (2) and (3) to cover the desired range.




                                                                                                       157

        Table 16 shows typical system characteristics generated by performing the parametric study
described above. The inlet pressures were arbitrarily selected to cover the expected operating range.
The GFSSP predicted mass flow rates are shown in the third column. The flow resistance coefficients
for the valve and the pipe are shown in the next two columns. The method of calculating these values
is discussed in section 2. The next three columns of table 16 show hand-calculated pressure drops over
the gate valve and the pipe and the pressure difference that is associated with the elevation change that
exists in the example 1 model. The sum of these three losses is tabulated in the next column. The last
column shows the overall pressure drop for the system for the given mass flow rate. A comparison of
the values contained in the last two columns shows good agreement.

        To determine the operating point of the system with a given pump, the system characteristics
can be plotted together with the pump characteristics. The system operating point will be determined
by the intersection of these two curves. Figure 102 shows the example 1 fluid system characteristics,
generated previously, plotted along with the pump characteristics data that are shown in table 15.
As seen from this figure, the operating point predicted by this method occurs at a pressure drop of
approximately 214 psid and a mass flow rate of 190 lbm/s which compares well with the predicted
results from the GFSSP model containing the pump.

                    6.2 Example 2—Simulation of a Water Distribution Network

6.2.1 Problem Considered

       In example 1, a single line pipe flow problem commonly encountered by pipe line designers
is analyzed. In this example, an example associated with multipath systems, commonly known as
flow networks, is considered. In general, water supply systems are considered as flow networks, since
nearly all such systems consist of many interconnecting pipes. A 10-pipe (commercial steel) distribu-
tion system is shown in figure 103. Water at 50 psia enters the circuit at boundary node 1. Water is
removed from the circuit at boundary nodes 3, 4, and 9 where pressures are also known. Use GFSSP
to determine pressures at all of the remaining nodes and the flow rates in all of the pipes. The length,
diameter, and roughness factors for each pipe are given in table 17. Note that pipes are designated as
branches in the subsequent discussions.

6.2.2 GFSSP Model

        The system shown in figure 103 is modeled by GFSSP in VTASC using 9 nodes and
10 branches as shown in figure 104. The fluid was assumed incompressible and therefore a constant
density (DENCON = .TRUE.) option was used. Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9 are boundary nodes where the
pressures are prescribed. Node 1 represents the inlet boundary node. Nodes 3, 4, and 9 are outlet
boundary nodes. All of the remaining nodes (2, 5, 6, 8, and 7) are internal nodes where the pressures
are calculated. All of the branches in this circuit simulate pipes. Therefore, each branch uses branch
resistance option 1. The length, diameter, and roughness factors of all branches are given in table 17.

        Figure 105 shows a comparison between GFSSP and Hardy Cross predicted flow rates. The
comparison appears reasonable considering the fact that the Hardy Cross method assumes a con-
stant friction factor in the branch while the GFSSP computes the friction factor for all branches.
Therefore, as the flow rates change, the friction factor also changes.

                           6.3 Example 3—Simulation of Compressible Flow in a Converging-Diverging Nozzle

6.3.1 Problem Considered

       In the previous examples, incompressible flows in fluid systems were considered. In this
example, compressible flow in a converging-diverging nozzle, demonstrating GFSSP’s capability
to handle compressibility, will be considered. One of the characteristics of the compressible flow
in a duct is that the flow rate becomes independent of exit pressure after reaching a threshold flow
rate. This threshold value is known as the choked flow rate and it is a function of inlet pressure
and temperature. Flow in a confined duct becomes choked when the flow velocity equals the local
velocity of sound. The purpose of this example is to investigate how accurately GFSSP can predict
the choked flow rate in a converging-diverging nozzle.

        The converging-diverging nozzle considered for this example is shown in figure 106. The
nozzle is 6.3 in long with a 0.492-in-diameter throat. The inlet diameter of the nozzle is 0.6758 in
and throat of the nozzle is located 0.158 in downstream of the inlet. The fluid considered was
steam at 150 psia and 1,000 ºF. The nozzle backpressure was varied from 134 to 45 psia. GFSSP
is desired to predict the flow rate and the pressure distribution for different exit pressures. The
predicted flow rate will also be compared with the isentropic solution.

6.3.2 GFSSP Model

        The fluid system shown in figure 106 can be simulated with a GFSSP model consisting of
17 nodes and 16 branches as shown in figure 107(a). Nodes 1 and 17 are the boundary nodes repre-
senting the inlet and outlet of the nozzle. All of the remaining nodes are internal nodes connected in
series. GFSSP can be used to construct an isentropic model by selecting branch resistance option 2
(flow through a restriction), using a flow coefficient, CL, set equal to zero and by setting the logical
flag INERTIA = .TRUE. This option eliminates friction from the momentum equation, which rep-
resents a balance between the inertia and pressure force with the inclusion of the inertia term. Each
branch assumes a constant flow area that was determined from the nozzle geometry at the mid point
of the branch location. The branch information is listed in table 20. Figure 107(b) shows how this
model appears in VTASC.

        It may be mentioned here that the temperature at the outlet boundary node has no influence
on the solution. However, the code must be supplied with a value to satisfy the input requirements
for a boundary node. In this example the temperature was specified arbitrarily to 1,000 ºF at node 17.
The boundary conditions are specified in table 21.

       The outlet boundary node pressures were varied to include 130, 100, 60, 50, and
45 psia. The input and output files (ex3.dat and ex3.out) from the example case
using an exit pressure of 60 psia are included in appendix J. The predicted pressure
distribu-tions for five test cases are shown in figure 108. Figure 109 shows the predicted
temperature distributions for the same cases.

        Table 22 lists the model predicted mass flow rates with varying exit pressures. As expected, the
mass flow rate increased as the exit pressure was decreased until the pressure ratio decreased below
the critical pressure ratio. At this point and below, the mass flow rate remained constant due to chok-
ing of the flow at the nozzle throat.

        The isentropic flow rate was calculated from equation (72). This equation assumes that the
inlet pressure is a stagnation pressure. GFSSP’s formulation assumes that the prescribed boundary
conditions are taken at a static condition. The nozzle inlet velocity head component must be added
to the GFSSP static inlet boundary pressure to obtain the correct nozzle inlet stagnation pressure to
use in equation (72) as shown in equation (73):

       A value of the specific heat ratio at the nozzle inlet boundary node was obtained from
GASP, and the inlet Mach Number from the first branch connected to the inlet node in the

       As the reader can see by comparing the results shown in table 22 and equation (75), there is
good agreement (approximately a 3% difference) between the GFSSP predicted choked flow rate
and the calculated isentropic choked flow rate. The prediction from first law based formulation has
also been compared with the second law formulation. In the first law formulation, enthalpy was used
as the dependent variable and equation (3a) was used instead of equation (3b). Unlike the second
law formulation where density is computed from pressure and entropy, the first law formulation
calculates density from pressure and enthalpy. The comparison of choked mass flow rate for both
formulations with the isentropic solution is shown in table 23. It may be noted that the entropy based
formulation more accurately predicts the mass flow rate than the enthalpy based formulation.

       To validate GFSSP’s ability to predict temperatures, the GFSSP predicted temperature at
the nozzle throat was also compared with a hand-calculated temperature using equation (76). This
equation assumes an isentropic process. In equation (76), the pressure P1 was assumed to be the total
pressure at the nozzle inlet that was calculated from equation (74) and the throat pressure was taken
from the GFSSP output:

       The GFSSP predicted nozzle throat temperature is 819.9 ºF. This temperature compares well,
within 3%, with the value calculated from equation (76).

        The isentropic steam nozzle model represents a reversible process in which no entropy is gen-
erated. In an actual steam nozzle there will be frictional losses that result in an increase in entropy. To
demonstrate GFSSP’s ability to predict the irreversibility (entropy generation) of a process, the isen-
tropic steam nozzle model was modified to allow for frictional losses. The branch resistance option
for each model branch was changed from option 2 with a CL = 0, to option 1 using the branch lengths
and diameters shown in figure 107 and assuming an absolute roughness of 0.01 in.

        Figure 110 shows a temperature/entropy comparison between the GFSSP isentropic steam
nozzle model and the GFSSP steam nozzle model with frictional losses. As one can see in the refer-
enced figure, the isentropic model predicts no change in entropy through the nozzle while the irre-
versible process predicts an increase in entropy of 0.019 Btu/(lbm ºR).

6.4.1 Problem Considered

        In the previous examples, the fluid systems that were considered employed a single fluid. In
this example, simulation of multiple fluids in a mixing process are considered. The MIXTURE logi-
cal option in the code to simulate the mixing of combustion gases and a cold gas stream by utilizing
the flow system shown is demonstrated in figure 111. A mixture of hot combustion products, con-
sisting of water vapor and oxygen, is mixed with cooler oxygen gas. The mixture temperature and
composition are required to be calculated.

mixes with pure oxygen at 500 psia and 80 ºF. GFSSP is desired to predict the flow rate, mixture tem-
perature, and composition of the mixture. A hand calculation of the mixture temperature and the
composition of the mixture will also be performed to verify GFSSP’s predictions.

6.4.2 GFSSP Model

        The mixing chamber shown in figure 111 can be simulated with a GFSSP model consisting
of four nodes and three branches as shown in figure 112. Nodes 1, 2, and 4 are the boundary nodes
representing the inlet and outlet of the mixing chamber and node 3 is the internal node representing
the mixing chamber. Branches 13 and 23 are represented by option 2 using a flow coefficient of 0.6
and area of 1 in2. Branch 34 also uses a flow coefficient of 0.6 and area of 1 in2, but it is modeled
using option 22. The reason option 22 is used for branch 34 is to account for the possibility of choked
flow in the branch.

       The input and output files of this example are included in appendix K as ex4.dat and
ex4.out. The predicted flow rates in branches 13, 23, and 34 are 1.16, 3.10, and 4.26 lbm/s,
respectively. The predicted temperature at the outlet of the mixing chamber, node 3, is 689 ºF and
the composition is 24.47% water vapor and 75.53% oxygen. The mixture will not vary between
nodes 3 and 4.
       Now, verification of the predicted results will be done by performing hand calculations of the
mixing process. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated from the energy conservation equa-
tion written for the mixing chamber. The energy conservation equation for node 3 can be written as:

                      xH O m

          The above equation can be rearranged to find T3:

      =

                  (4.26 lb/s)(0.3757 Btu/lb-ºR)

       Equation (78) calculates the temperature to be 689.5 ºF, which compares well with the GFSSP
prediction of 688.6 ºF.

       The mass concentration of the specie can be calculated from the specie conservation equation
for node 3. The concentration of water vapor and oxygen, respectively, can be expressed as:

The concentration of water vapor and oxygen from the above equations are 0.2451 and 0.7549,
respectively, which also compares well with the GFSSP predictions.

             6.5 Example 5—Simulation of a Flow System Involving a Heat Exchanger

6.5.1 Problem Considered

        In dealing with fluid system analysis, engineers often encounter systems that contain a heat
exchanger. It is important that the thermal behavior of a heat exchanger is correctly accounted for in any
system simulation. Otherwise, temperature discrepancies in the fluid property calculations will result in
inaccurate system characteristics being predicted. The following example demonstrates GFSSP’s abil-
ity to accurately predict fluid temperatures in a heat exchanger system using effectiveness calculations.

        GFSSP has the ability to calculate temperatures downstream of a heat exchanger for three dif-
ferent cases. For the first case, a known heat exchanger effectiveness is used by GFSSP to calculate the
flow temperatures downstream from the heat exchanger. The second case involves requiring GFSSP
to calculate the effectiveness of the heat exchanger using the counter flow heat exchanger equations.
That calculated effectiveness is then used to calculate the heat exchanger downstream temperatures.
For the third case, the heat exchanger effectiveness is calculated using the parallel flow heat exchanger
equations and the heat exchanger downstream temperatures are calculated from that effectiveness.

        A simple counter flow heat exchanger system configuration, as shown in figure 113, was cho-
sen for this example. As shown in figure 113, counter flow occurs when the hot branch of the heat
exchanger has flow that is propagating in a direction opposite of the cold branch. This counter flow
heat exchanger configuration consists of hot water, at 50 psi and 100 ºF, flowing through 10 in of
0.25-in inner diameter pipe, through a 10-in-long heat exchanger and out through another 10-in-long
section of 0.25-in inner diameter pipe at 25 psi. Also, cold water, at 50 psi and 60 ºF flows through
a 10-in section of 0.5-in inner diameter pipe, through the heat exchanger, and out through another
10-in section of 0.5-in inner diameter pipe at 25 psi. All of the pipes are assumed to have an absolute
roughness of zero. At the conditions described above, Cp = 0.9978 Btu/lbm-ºR is calculated for the
hot water and Cp = 1.0014 Btu/lbm-°R is calculated for the cold water.

6.5.2 GFSSP Model

         A GFSSP model consisting of eight nodes and six branches can represent the counter flow
heat exchanger system shown in figure 113. This model is shown in figure 114(a). Nodes 1, 4, 5,
and 8 are boundary nodes. Nodes 1 and 5, the inlet boundary nodes for the hot and cold flow,
respectively, both have a pressure of 50 psi. In addition, the boundary temperature at node 1 is
100 ºF while the boundary temperature at node 5 is 60 ºF. Nodes 4 and 8, which are the downstream
boundary nodes for the hot and cold flow, both have a boundary pressure of 25 psi. Downstream
boundary temperatures are not used in GFSSP calculations so ‘dummy’ temperature values of
80 and 70 ºF are used for the hot and cold flow downstream boundary nodes. Nodes 2 and 6 are
internal nodes that represent the entrances to the heat exchanger for the hot and cold flow, respec-
tively. In the same manner, nodes 3 and 7 are internal nodes that represent the hot and cold flow
heat exchanger exits. Branches 12, 34, 56, and 78 represent the pipes leading into and out of the heat
exchanger for both the hot and cold flows. Finally, branches 23 and 67 represent the hot and cold
sides of the heat exchanger. Figure 114(b) shows how this model appears in VTASC.

       6.5.2.2 Branches 23 and 67 (Heat Exchanger). Option 1 was also used to simulate the two
heat exchanger branches. In addition to providing the length, inner diameter, and ε /D for the two
branches, the user must designate additional information in the Heat Exchanger dialog window
shown in figure 115. First, the user must add a heat exchanger using the Add button. Next, the user
must input which branch represents the hot flow side of the exchanger and which branch represents
the cold flow side of the exchanger. Also, the user may either designate an effectiveness between zero
and 1 or enter an effectiveness >1 and designate the type of heat exchanger in the system and a value
for UA. UA is the product of the overall conductance for heat transfer and the surface area on which
that conductance is based.




                              Figure 115. VTASC Heat Exchanger dialog.


       The example 5 GFSSP input and output data files (ex5.dat and ex5.out) are
included in appendix L. The output file includes all of the input data, the trial solution for the
internal nodes, and the final model solution.

       The first area of interest is the counter flow heat exchanger effectiveness calculations. Dur-
ing the GFSSP preprocessor input, a value for UA and an effectiveness are input to define the heat
exchanger’s characteristics. For these verifications, a value for UA was assumed with the following
process. It was assumed that the heat exchanger had an effectiveness of ε = 0.7. A GFSSP model was
run with that effectiveness to obtain the mass flow rates. The mass flow rate for the cold branch was
calculated to be 5.41 lbm/s and the flow rate for the hot branch was calculated to be 0.885 lbm/s.
Then, equations (81) and (82) were used to calculate the hot and cold fluid capacity rates:24



           Ch = m Cp (   )hot branch = (0.885 lbm/s)(0.9978 Btu/lbm –ºR) = 0.883 Btu/s-ºR       (81)

and


                  (
           Cc = m Cp     )cold branch = (5.41 lbm/s)(1.0014 Btu/lbm –ºR) = 5.418 Btu/s-ºR .     (82)



                                                                                                  173

       Based on the previously calculated values, Cmax = Cc and Cmin = Ch. For the counter flow heat
exchanger case, it was assumed that Cmax, Cmin, and ε would remain the same as the values above.
Next, a counter flow exchanger performance table was used, along with the previously calculated
values, to estimate the number of heat transfer units, Ntu = 1.25, for the counter flow exchanger.24
Then equation (83) was used to calculate UA in equation (84):24

                                                               UA
                                                       Ntu =                                      (83)
                                                               C min
and

                    UA = NtuC min = (1.25)(0.883 Btu/s-ºR) = 1.10375 Btu/s-ºR) .                  (84)


       A value >1 was used for the effectiveness, which instructed GFSSP to calculate the effective-
ness instead of employing a user input value. For this case, the counter flow heat exchanger option
was chosen. Figure 116 shows the predicted temperatures and mass flow rates from this model.

       The mass flow rates predicted by this model (0.885 lbm/s at branch 12 and 5.41 lbm/s at
branch 56) were the same as predicted for the counter flow exchanger that was used for the assumed
case. Therefore, Cc and Ch remained the same. The heat exchanger effectiveness is not included in the
data written to the GFSSP output file so it was necessary to calculate the effectiveness that GFSSP
used. GFSSP’s effectiveness was calculated using equation (85):24

     Good agreement can be seen in a comparison between the hand-calculated value and the
GFSSP value.

       The second area of interest is the accuracy of GFSSP’s temperature predictions at the nodes
downstream of the hot and cold heat exchanger branches. Equation (85) was manipulated to come
up with equations (87) and (88) which were used to hand-calculate Th,out and Tc,out:24

and 64.51 °F at node 7 in figure 116 shows very good agreement, verifying the heat exchanger tem-
perature calculation process used by the GFSSP code.

                        6.6 Example 6—Radial Flow on a Rotating Radial Disk

6.6.1 Problem Considered

        This example illustrates the rotational effect (centrifugal force contribution) capabil-
ity of GFSSP by modeling the flow of water through a closed impeller.41 The impeller has an
11-in diameter, uses water as the operating fluid, and is running at 5,000 rpm. The ‘slip’ of the
fluid is described by the rotational K-factor (Krotation). Krotation is defined as the ratio of the mean
circumferential fluid speed divided by the impeller speed: (Krotation = uθ /rω). (Higher Krotation
factors translate to a higher pressure rise for radially outward flow.) A Krotation for each side of
the impeller has been proposed and it is the purpose of this example to validate these Krotation
correlations. The proposed correlations are (Kfront face = 0.8455  –  0.1403(r – ri / ro – ri ) for the front
face; (Kback face = 0.8857 – 0.1762(r – ri / ro – ri ) for the back face. It is desired to compare the results
with experimental data. The impeller is schematically shown in figure 117. For this example, the
effects of friction will be neglected for the rotating branches.

        The GFSSP model circuit is shown in figure 118. All branches are modeled using option 2.
In the model, branches 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 89, 910, 1011, and 1112 are rotating at 5,000 rpm. The
inlet and outlet radii are defined in the preprocessor for each of the rotating branches. The area
of each of the radial branches is calculated as the average cross-sectional area for each branch,
#A           = 1 rb ! ra " 2! rd r % . Figure 118(b) shows how this model appears in VTASC.

damper is installed at the bearing supports of a rotor-stator system on the outer race of a rolling-
element bearing. The squeeze film damper consists of inner and outer elements separated by fluid
(usually an oil). The inner element is mounted to the outer race of the rolling-element bearing, and
the outer element is mounted to the bearing support. The arrangement is similar to a journal bear-
ing except that the inner damper element does not rotate; it only translates. In order to calculate the
effect of the squeeze film damper on the system, the forces generated by the squeeze film damper in
the radial and tangential directions must be estimated. The forces are estimated by integrating the
pressure distribution of the fluid in the damper. The difficulty for the designer/analyst is the estima-
tion of the pressure distribution. The following example problem demonstrates how GFSSP can be
used to predict this pressure distribution.

  List of Figures



        The squeeze film damper considered for this example is shown schematically in figures 120 and
121. Since the damper has sealed ends, the axial flow is neglected. The diameter (d) of the bearing is
5 in, the width (w) of the bearing is 0.94 in, the clearance (c) is 0.0625 in, and the ratio of the dynamic
eccentricity (ε, radius of orbit to the clearance) is 0.82. The fluid density (ρ) is 57.806 lbm/ft3. The fluid
viscosity (µ) is 5.932 × 10–3 lbm/(ft•s). The running speed (ω) is set at 1,770 rpm (ω = 185.354 radians/s).
GFSSP will be used to determine the pressure distribution around the damper and the results will be
compared with experimental data.42

6.7.2 GFSSP Model

        A GFSSP model consisting of 20 nodes and 19 branches can approximate the fluid contained
within the squeeze film damper system shown in figures 120 and 121. The fluid to be used is not con-
tained in the standard library of fluids and is assumed to be incompressible; therefore, the constant
density feature of GFSSP must be used. In order to model the squeeze film damper, the damper will
be ‘unwrapped.’ Figure 122 shows the unwrapping of the damper and the discretization of the flow
region. The GFSSP model is shown in figure 123. As is shown in figure 123, nodes 1 and 20 are the
boundary nodes. The branches will use branch resistance option 3—Non Circular Duct, Sub-option
1 - Rectangular Duct. The heights of the branches are given in table 24. The motion of the inner ele-
ment will be simulated using the moving boundary option in GFSSP. (Only the motion of the damper
normal to the inner element is modeled in this technique.) The velocity of the moving boundary is given
in table 25. Setting the boundary nodes at the same pressure will simulate the periodic behavior of the
damper. The boundary pressure is set at 0.0 psi.

  List of Figures



        The pressure distribution predicted by GFSSP is shown in figure 124. The plot of pressure
versus angle (i.e., node position) in figure 124 shows that the pressure is symmetric about the bound-
ary pressure of zero psi. The model results are compared to experimental results in figure 125. In
figure 125, the pressure is normalized with a characteristic pressure (CpRe) and the angle has been
converted to compare to a dimensionless time (wt) for comparison with the experimental data. As
seen in figure 125, the pressure profile of the GFSSP model compares favorably with the experimen-
tal results in shape and magnitude; the only major difference between the two results is a phase shift.

                 6.8 Example 8 —Simulation of the Blowdown of a Pressurized Tank

6.8.1 Problem Considered

       In the previous examples, the simulation of steady state flow in a given flow circuit was con-
sidered. In this example, the capabilities of the unsteady flow formulation of GFSSP to simulate the
process of blowing down a pressurized tank will be deployed.

        Consider a tank with an internal volume of 10 ft3, containing air at a pressure and tempera-
ture of 100 psia and 80 ºF, respectively. Air is discharged into the atmosphere through an orifice
of 0.1-in diameter for a period of 200 s. GFSSP will be used to determine the pressure, mass flow
rate, and temperature history of the isentropic blowdown process. These predicted values are then

        The physical schematic for example 8 is shown in figure 126(a) and a schematic of the cor-
responding GFSSP model is shown in figure 126(b). Figure 126(c) shows how the model looks in
VTASC. The venting process can be modeled with two nodes and one branch. Node 1 is an internal
node that represents the tank. For the unsteady formulation, the node volume and the initial condi-
tions must be supplied for each internal node and a history file must be supplied for each boundary
node. The history file contains the pressures, temperatures, and concentrations at discrete times. At
a minimum, this file should include values at the process start time and at some time corresponding
to the expected process stop time. Additional times can be included to account for nonlinear varia-
tion in the values if required. The code interpolates in the history file data to determine the values for
a particular instant. Shown below is a listing of EX8HS2.DAT, which is the history file of example 8,
used to provide the boundary conditions for node 2. The file listing has been annotated to explain the
meaning of the entries.

EX8HS2.DAT

       2 - Number of data points
       tau(sec)   p(psia)    T (°F)           Concentration
       0          14.700     80.00            1.00
       1000       14.700     80.00            1.00

       In addition to supplying the internal node volumes and history data files, the time step
(DTAU), start time (TAUF), stop time (TAUL), and print interval (NPSTEP) must also be included
within the model input data file when creating an unsteady flow (STEADY = .False.) model.

       The initial pressure within the tank (node 1) was 100 psia. Resistance option 22 was used
for branch 12 with a flow coefficient of 1. Air is modeled using the ideal gas option that is available
in VTASC.

        As an interesting note, this example could be used to model an isothermal process by using
the SORCEQ User Subroutine. The temperature of the fluid remains constant in an isothermal pro-
cess. In this example it is presumed that initially the air and tank wall are at the same temperature.
During blowdown, the air temperature tends to drop. With heat transfer from the wall, temperature
drop would be less compared to an isentropic process. For an isothermal process, there will be no
change in temperature. This particular situation (isothermal) can be modeled by setting an infinite
heat transfer coefficient between the wall and fluid in SORCEQ.

         The analytical and GFSSP solutions are compared in figure 127. The figure shows a compari-
son between the GFSSP solution and the analytical solution of pressures. The difference in pressures
is also shown plotted for three different time steps (1, 0.1, and 0.01 s). The discrepancies between
analytical and numerical solutions are found to diminish with reduction in time step. This observa-
tion is in conformity with expectations.

6.9.1 Problem Considered

       This example further illustrates GFSSP’s capability to model complex unsteady flow. Fig-
ure 128 shows the piston-cylinder configuration considered by this example problem. The cylinder
has a diameter of 3 in. Within the cylinder is nitrogen gas, sealed in by a piston moving at a rotational
speed of 1,200 rpm and a stroke of 3 in. GFSSP will be used to predict the pressure and temperature
within the system and the results will be compared with the isentropic solution.


                                                                 x

6.9.2 GFSSP Model

        In order to model this configuration, a coordinate transformation is utilized. In this new
coordinate system, the endplate of the cylinder is modeled as another piston and the origin of the
coordinate system is at the mid point between the two ‘pistons.’ Figure 129 demonstrates the modi-
fied piston-cylinder arrangement.

       The GFSSP model of the piston-cylinder arrangement consists of two internal nodes and
one branch (note: the model does not have any boundary nodes). Figure 130(a) shows the GFSSP
piston-cylinder model. In order to model the motion of the piston, two special options are utilized:
the moving boundary option and the variable geometry option. The moving boundary option is
required to adequately model the work input by the motion of the pistons. The variable geometry
option is required to model the variation of the geometry of branch 12. The initial condition of the
nitrogen in the cylinder is 14.7 psia and 75 ºF. Figure 130(b) shows how the model looks in VTASC.

         Figures 131 and 132 compare the results of the GFSSP piston-cylinder model with the ana-
lytical solution from equations (92) and (93). As these figures illustrate, the GFSSP model compares
favorably to the analytical solution. It should be noted that the isentropic solution uses a constant ratio
of specific heats (γ ), whereas GFSSP accounts for the variation of specific heat ratios with changes in
temperature and pressure.

6.10.1 Problem Considered

        Example 8 demonstrates the use of GFSSP’s unsteady formulation by predicting the pressure
and temperature history during the blowdown of a pressurized tank. A more complex unsteady pro-
cess will be considered in this example, the pressurization of a propellant tank.32 This example will
also illustrate the use of User Subroutines to construct a model of mass transfer due to evaporation
of propellant to the ullage space.

       The tank pressurization option incorporated in GFSSP models the following physical
processes:

       (1) Change in ullage and propellant volume.
       (2) Change in gravitational head in the tank.
       (3) Heat transfer from pressurant to propellant.
       (4) Heat transfer from pressurant to the tank wall.
       (5) Heat conduction between the pressurant exposed tank surface and the propellant exposed
           tank surface.
       (6) Mass transfer from propellant to ullage.




                                                                                                                                   189

         A schematic of a propellant pressurization system is shown in figure 133. It is assumed that
initially the ullage space is filled with pressurant at propellant temperature. As the warm pressurant
enters the ullage space, it mixes with the cold ullage gas and the temperature of the ullage gas starts to
increase due to mixing and compression. Initially, the walls of the tank are also at propellant tempera-
ture. Heat transfer from the ullage gas to the propellant and the tank wall and mass transfer from the
propellant to the ullage start immediately after the pressurant begins flowing into the tank. Propellant
flows from the tank to the engine under the influence of ullage pressure and gravitational head in the
tank. In the current model, condensation of propellant vapor has been neglected.

6.10.2 GFSSP Model

         A five-node pressurization system GFSSP test model, as shown in figure 134(a), was developed
to test the implementation of the pressurization option. Helium at 95 psia and 120 °F enters the ullage
space, which is initially filled with helium at 67 psia and –264 °F. Node 2 represents the ullage space,
which has an initial volume of 25 ft3. A pseudo boundary node (node 3) has been introduced to exert
ullage pressure on the initial propellant volume of 475 ft3, which is represented by node 4. The pres-
sure at the pseudo boundary node is calculated from the ullage pressure and gravitational head and
is the driving force to supply the propellant to the engine. This pressure is calculated at the beginning
of each time step. Branch 12 models the tank inlet, branch 34 represents the propellant surface, and
branch 45 represents the line to the engine. All three branches were modeled using a Flow Through a
Restriction (option 2). The flow coefficient of branch 45 is adjusted to restrict the propellant flow such
that all propellant is expelled from the tank over the course of the run. In this test model, the engine
inlet pressure was set at 50 psia. Figure 134(b) shows how the model looks in VTASC. Figure 135
shows the VTASC tank pressurization dialog and inputs for example 10.

       6.10.2.1 User Subroutine. The calculation of mass transfer from propellant to ullage is not
a capability that is available with the pressurization option, so in the course of developing this test
model, separate coding was written to account for the mass transfer. This coding was included in
the user routine SORCEC. This routine uses the heat transfer rate from the ullage to the propellant
to calculate the mass transfer rate of vaporized propellant to the ullage. It is assumed that the pro-
pellant is vaporized from the surface and the heat transfer from the ullage only contributes to the
vaporization of propellant. The mass transfer due to vaporization is expressed as:

                                                                 Q prop

       The saturation temperature in equation (94) is calculated using the vapor pressure relation:

of the vapor pressure relation constants for the propellants considered in these routines.

where vg is found using the Lee and Kesler modified BWR equation as described by Reid et al.44 with
the exception of RP-1, where vg is calculated using the ideal gas equation. vf is determined from the
following correlation:

where C0, C1, C2, etc. are curve fit constants. It should be noted that in the case of RP-1, vf is
assumed to be constant at a value of 0.01923 ft3/lbm. Table 27 lists the values of the correlation con-
stants for the other propellants considered in these routines.

       6.10.2.2 Subroutine SORCEC. This subroutine is called from subroutine MASSC. The pur-
                                                                                    v
pose of this subroutine is to calculate the rate of mass transfer of propellant, m! prop , in the ullage
space due to evaporation. This subroutine can handle four liquid propellants, namely nitrogen,
oxygen, hydrogen, and RP-1. For each fluid, the saturation temperature and enthalpy of evaporation
were computed in subroutine SATPRP. SORCECON(IPUL,KFLU) is the source term of propel-
lant specie in the ullage node and SORCEMAS is the mass source in the ullage node. The subrou-
tine SATPRP calculates saturation temperature of the propellant at the prevailing ullage pressure.
It employs a Newton-Raphson method to compute temperature from the vapor pressure relation
shown in equation (95) It also calls subroutine BWR to calculate specific volumes of liquid and
vapor at a given pressure and temperature. Finally, it calculates enthalpy of evaporation as given in
equation (96).

       6.10.2.3 Subroutine PRNUSER. This subroutine is called from subroutine PRINT, with the
purpose of writing specific variables in a file for plotting. The variables written in this subroutine
include various heat and mass transfer rates, temperature, and volumes. For a description of
each variable, the reader is referred to appendix D.

6.10.3 Results

        The User Subroutine input and output files including history files of example 10 have
been attached in appendix Q. The pressurization system transient test model was run for 200 s with
a 0.1-s time step.

        Figure 136 shows both the ullage pressure and tank bottom pressure histories for the test
model. After an initial pressure rise due to a ‘ramping up’ transient effect, both pressures begin a slow
but steady decline for the remainder of the run. It should be noted that tank bottom pressure was cal-
culated by adding ullage pressure with pressure due to the gravitational head. Figure 136 shows that
as the gravitational head decreases, the ullage and tank bottom pressures slowly converge until all
propellant is drained from the tank. The slow decline in ullage pressure is mainly due to the expand-
ing ullage volume.

        Figure 137 shows the histories for the ullage temperature and the tank wall temperature. This
figure shows that the tank wall temperature rises 32º over the course of the model run. It reveals that
the 120 ºF helium gas entering the tank has an increasing effect on the tank wall as propellant is
drained from the tank and the wall surface area exposed to the warmer ullage gas grows. This effect
is somewhat dampened, however, because the heat gained by the wall is conducted to the portion
of the tank that is submerged in LOX, which acts as a heat sink. The ullage temperature rises 192º
during the first 60 s of tank pressurization before beginning a slow decline for the remainder of the
simulation. This large initial temperature rise is primarily due to the mixing of hot helium gas with
the relatively cold gas present in the ullage. The decline in temperature is a result of expansion due to
a continuous increase of the ullage volume.

         Helium flow rate into the tank is shown in figure 138. The helium flow rate was found to drop
initially as the start transient takes place, which is consistent with the ‘ramp up’ effect noted in fig-
ure 136. Then the flow rate begins to gradually increase as ullage pressure drops due to the expanding
ullage volume. LOX flow rate into the engine is shown in figure 139. The LOX flow rate curve mirrors
the ullage and tank bottom pressure curves, rising through an initial start transient to a peak value
and then declining for the remainder of the run as tank pressure drops.

       Figure 140 shows the mass transfer rate of gaseous oxygen (GOX) into    the ullage space over
the duration of the run. The mass transfer rate curve mirrors the ullage temperature curve, which is
what one expects since the mass transfer is based on the ullage to propellant heat transfer, which is
based on ullage temperature. GFSSP predicts a final GOX mass concentration of 0.15 in the ullage.

       As a validation, the model results were compared with a published correlation of pressurant
requirements for a given displacement of propellant as published by Epstein and Anderson.45 The
correlation calculates the collapse factor, which is defined by Van Dresar46 as a ratio of the actual
pressurant consumption to an ideal pressurant consumption where no heat or mass transfer from the
pressurant occurs. This correlation takes the form shown in equations (98) through (102):

        For this validation exercise, the tank is assumed to be cylindrical and therefore the tank
diameter is used in place of Van Dresar’s equivalent diameter definition. The tank characteris-
tics used are those values utilized in the GFSSP test model. Also, the ideal pressurant properties
                                    0                 3
of c 0p = 1.24 Btu/lbm-R and ρG = 0.06087 lbm/ft are found using the helium inlet conditions
        G
of P0 = 95 psia and T0 = 120 ºF. The saturation temperature (Ts) of LOX is taken to be –264 ºF.
The heat transfer coefficient is calculated to be h = 8.36 × 10 –4 Btu/ft2-s-°R by taking the average
value of the heat transfer coefficients calculated by GFSSP at each time step. The change in propel-
lant volume is the value predicted by the GFSSP test model, and the ambient heat flux is neglected
in this model. The constants p1 through p8 are provided by Epstein and Anderson45 and are shown
in table 28.

       Solving equations (100) through (102) and substituting into equation (98) gives w p / w p = 1.51.
                               0
Solving equation (99) gives w p = 28.9 lbm. The GFSSP output file predicts a required pressurant
mass of approximately 46.29 lbm. Dividing this number by the ideal pressurant mass gives a GFSSP
predicted collapse factor of 1.6. Therefore, the predicted discrepancy of GFSSP with respect to
Epstein’s method is 5.96%. It is believed that this discrepancy is due mainly to the sensitivity of the
pressurization process to the heat transfer coefficient, which is difficult to calculate accurately.

                   6.11 Example 11—Power Balancing of a Turbopump Assembly

6.11.1 Problem Considered

        Example 11 illustrates the modeling of the mechanical coupling between two flow components.
In the turbopump assembly shown in figure 141, a co-axial shaft mechanically connects the pump and
turbine. The power required by the pump must be transmitted from the turbine in order for the system
to be in balance. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate this power balancing for a turbopump
when used in a gas turbine cycle. The physical plausibility of the predicted results was demonstrated by
performing parametric studies on shaft speed.

6.11.2 GFSSP Model                                NewF141_1509

        A model of the turbopump portion of a flow circuit is shown in figure 142(a). This model
consists of an inlet from a hydrogen tank, a turbopump assembly (pump, turbine, and a connec-
tion between them (shaft)), two heat exchangers, a bypass dump outlet, and an outlet to the power
turbine. The first of the heat exchangers (denoted in fig. 142(a) as the Regenerator) is used to heat
a small portion of the main LH2 flow by using the ‘hotter’ hydrogen exiting the turbine, while the
remainder of the LH2 flow bypasses this heat exchanger. The second heat exchanger is used to boil
and superheat the hydrogen by means of external heat addition. The shaft speed for this model is set
in the input file to 80,000 rpm. Figure 142(b) shows how this model looks in VTASC.

   This model uses the following options:

• Branch Resistance Options:
  (1) Pipe Flow (option 1).
  (2) Pump with Pump Efficiency (option 15).
  (3) Valve with a Given Cv (option 16).

• Special Options:
  (1) Heat Exchanger (2), (Logical Variable HEX).
  (2) Turbopump Assembly (1) , (Logical Variable TPA).

       Each pipe flow branch has a length of 100 in, an inside diameter of 0.3927 in, and an absolute
roughness of 0.00098175 in. Branches 89, 1112, and 1618 each have Cv = 3.554 and A = 0.19635 in2.
Branch 12 has Cv = 2.877 with A = 0.19635 in2 while branch 1617 has Cv = 0.00354 with A = 0.01 in2.
The branch options chosen to represent the turbine (branch 1213) and the pump (branch 23) have no
bearing on the model calculations except for the flow areas that are provided. For this case, option 15
was used for both branches with arbitrary inputs for pump horsepower and efficiency. The flow areas
are 0.12112 in2 for branch 23 and 0.019635 in2 for branch 1213. The turbopump characteristics are

        In order to verify this complicated model, a parametric study on the shaft speed of the tur-
bopump was conducted. Figures 146–148 illustrate the results of this model. Figure 146 illustrates
the pressure differential across the turbopump for both the pump and the turbine as a function of the
shaft speed. Figure 147 illustrates the hydrogen mass flow rate through the turbopump as a function
of the shaft speed. Figure 148 illustrates the torque and horsepower transmitted in the turbopump as
a function of the shaft speed. As each of these figures illustrates, a functional relationship is identifi-
able for each predicted variable as a function of shaft speed.

           6.12 Example 12 —Helium Pressurization of LOX and RP-1 Propellant Tanks

6.12.1 Problem Considered

        Example 10 illustrates the use of the pressurization option in modeling ullage and propel-
lant conditions in a tank. In this example, an integrated model consisting of two propellant tanks,
a flow network for the ullage pressurant supply from a Facility interface, and engine propellant feed
lines will be constructed. The pressurization system of Propulsion Test Article 1 (PTA1) consists of
a LOX tank and an RP-1 tank that are both pressurized by helium. This configuration is represented
in the schematic shown in figure 149. The objective of the present example is to develop an integrated
mathematical model from the helium supply line to the engine inlet to model 60 s of engine opera-
tions. The model has three primary functions:

      (1) To predict the flow rate and pressure distribution of the helium supply line feeding both
the LOX and RP-1 tanks.

       (2) To predict the ullage conditions considering heat transfer between the ullage, propellant,
and the tank wall, as well as mass transfer from propellant to ullage.

       (3) To predict the propellant conditions leaving the tank.

6.12.2 GFSSP Model

       A GFSSP model of the helium pressurization system of LOX and RP-1 tanks is shown in
figure 150(a). The model consists of 65 nodes and 64 branches. The model extends from facility
interface to engine purge and engine chamber interfaces. It includes all piping and its fittings, orifices,
and valves. Both RP-1 and LOX tanks and pumps are included in the model. Each propellant tank
has a diffuser and control valve. Pressure and temperatures are specified at the interfaces, which are
represented by six boundary nodes listed in table 29.

       It may be noted that the nodes representing ullage-propellant interface (nodes 55 and 30)
are pseudo boundary nodes. The code uses the calculated ullage pressure at the previous time step
instead of pressures provided by the user through history files. Helium enters into the system from
the facility interface where it is distributed into three parallel branches. The first branching takes
place after 128 in of pipe line and this branch supplies helium to the engine for engine purges. The

208

second branching takes place 305 in downstream of the first branch and this branch supplies helium
to the LOX tank. The rest of the helium goes to pressurize the RP-1 tank. The lines leading to the
LOX and RP-1 tanks each have two parallel legs, one of which remains closed during operation. The
left leg of the circuit is used to pressurize the tank during prepressurization operation while the right
leg of the circuit is used to pressurize the tank during pressurization standby and engine operations.
In the model discussed in this TP, setting a high resistance in the appropriate branches eliminated the
flow to the left leg. Figure 150(b) shows how this model looks in VTASC.

6.12.3 Results

       The input and output files including history files of example 12 have been attached
in appendix S. The GFSSP model shown in figure 147 was run for a 60-s engine operation
period. At the beginning of the model run, the control valve nominal set points are 72 psia for
the LOX tank and 55 psia for the RP-1 tank with ±3 psi tolerances. After 3 s they drop 5 psi to
67 psia for the LOX tank and 50 psia for the RP-1 tank with ±3 psi tolerances. The output file
contains pressure, tem-perature, and density at all nodes as well as flow rate, velocity,
and pressure drop at all branches for selected time steps.

        Figure 151 shows the predicted pressure history of the RP-1 ullage, RP-1 tank bottom, LOX
ullage, and LOX tank bottom pressures. The difference in pressure between the tank bottom and
ullage is the gravitational head, which slowly reduces as propellant is drained from the tank. The
cyclic nature of the pressure profiles is due to the control valves, which are set to close or open as
the tank bottom pressures exceed prescribed tolerances. It is observed that the frequency of pres-
sure oscillation is larger in the LOX tank than the RP-1 tank. This observation is attributable to the
higher flow rates associated with the LOX tank as compared to those required for the RP-1 tank.

        Figure 152 shows the predicted ullage temperature history in the RP-1 tank. Initially, wall
and propellant temperatures were assumed equal at 70 °F. Heat transfer between ullage gas and the
wall is not very significant in the RP-1 tank and, as a result, the tank wall temperature rises less than
a degree during the 60-s engine operation. Ullage temperature, on the other hand, increases by about
42 °F due to mixing and pressurization. Ullage temperature diminishes during the period of valve
closure because of the heat transfer from ullage gas to the wall.

                                          Figure 152. RP-1 temperature history.


       Figure 153 shows the heat transfer history for the RP-1 tank. The ullage to propellant heat
transfer rises mirrors the RP-1 ullage temperature behavior, reaching a peak value of 0.297 Btu/s.
The ullage to wall heat transfer grows continuously throughout engine operation, achieving a maxi-
mum value of 1.78 Btu/s. This continuous rise is due to the ever-increasing tank wall area exposed to
ullage gas as propellant is expelled from the tank. Conduction from the ullage exposed tank wall to
the wetted wall is negligible compared to the heat transfer between the ullage and the wall.

        The predicted ullage temperature history in the LOX tank is shown in figure 154. The LOX
ullage temperature is assumed to be initially at –260 °F and the tank wall temperature is assumed to
be initially at –300 °F. The tank wall temperature rise is more pronounced in the LOX tank than the
RP-1 tank, rising 8 °F over the course of the 60-s run. The ullage temperature, on the other hand,
rises about 147 °F. The higher temperature rise in the LOX tank is primarily due to the fact that the
LOX ullage is initially assumed to be at –260 °F and mixes with helium at 120 °F. On the other hand,
the initial temperature difference in the RP-1 ullage is much smaller. The other contributing factor is
the higher helium flow rate into the LOX tank.

       Figure 155 shows the LOX tank heat transfer history. The LOX heat transfer curves follow
a similar pattern to the RP-1 tank heat transfer curves, but on a much greater scale. The ullage to
propellant heat transfer achieves a maximum value of 2.72 Btu/s and ullage to wall heat transfer
peaks at 22.2 Btu/s.

        The mass transfer history of propellant into the ullage for the LOX and RP-1 tanks is shown
in figure 156. The mass transfer of propellant to ullage was calculated using the User Subroutines
discussed in section 6.10 (example 10). The mass transfer rate of GOX into the LOX tank ullage is
much larger than that of vaporized RP-1 into the RP-1 tank ullage due to the higher heat transfer
rates seen in the LOX tank. At the end of the 60-s run, the mass concentration of GOX in the LOX
tank ullage is 0.14, while the mass concentration of vaporized RP-1 in the RP-1 tank ullage is 0.002.

                                                     Figure 156. Mass transfer history of propellant.


       The propellant flow rates shown in figure 157 are to be 139 lbm/s for LOX and 64 lbm/s for
RP-1. The constant propellant flow rate predictions are a result of the RP-1 and LOX pumps. The
branches upstream and downstream of the pumps have been adjusted to reproduce the pressure drops
associated with the flow paths between the tanks and pump inlets and pump exits and engine chamber.
This was done because of a lack of detailed flow path geometry downstream of the propellant tanks.

       While propellant is discharged to the engine, ullage volume increases. The increase in the ullage
volume in the RP-1 and LOX tanks is shown in figure 158. The initial ullage volume of the RP-1 tank
was assumed to be 15 ft3 while the LOX tank initial ullage volume was assumed to be 25 ft3. The ullage
volumes increase linearly to 90 ft3 and 141 ft3 for the RP-1 and LOX tanks, respectively.

        Figure 159 shows the helium flow rates in the system. Helium flow rate varies over time due
to the opening and closing of the control valves during this time period. The flow from the facility
interface is distributed to three branches. A nearly constant flow rate (about 0.4 lbm/s) is predicted
to the engine purge interface for engine purges. The maximum flow rates to the LOX and RP-1 tanks
are about 0.34 lbm/s and 0.085 lbm/s, respectively. Table 30 shows a comparison of GFSSP helium
flow predictions with McRight’s47 pressurization analysis model.

        The comparison shown in table 30 appears reasonable considering the fact that McRight’s
analysis did not consider pressure loss in lines and fittings and choked flow rate through the orifice
was calculated based on a facility pressure of 765 psia. GFSSP calculates pressure drop through the
line; therefore, the choked flow rate at lower pressure is evidently less than McRight’s prediction.

       6.13 Example 13—Steady State Conduction Through a Circular Rod, With Convection

6.13.1 Problem Considered

         In the previous examples, the focus has been on GFSSP’s fluid modeling capabilities. In
this example, GFSSP’s ability to model applications with conjugate heat transfer is introduced.
The verification and validation of GFSSP’s conjugate heat transfer capability was performed by
comparing with the known solution of a simple conduction-convection problem.48 The heat transfer
in a homogenous circular rod between two walls was considered (fig. 160). The two walls are held
at temperatures of 32 and 212 ºF,, respectively. The 0.167-ft-diameter rod is 2 ft in length and is
initially at a temperature of 70 ºF. The heat transfer coefficient between the rod and the ambient air
is 1.14 Btu/ft2-hr-R and the thermal conductivity of the rod is 9.4 Btu/ft-hr-R.

6.13.2 GFSSP Model

        Figure 161(a) shows a GFSSP schematic of the system described by figure 160. The circular
rod is represented by eight solid nodes and seven solid-solid conductors. Even though all of the mate-
rial properties are not used for a steady state model, GFSSP still requires that placeholder values be
input at each solid node. The thermal conductivity and specific heat temperature history files, which
are shown below in an annotated form, are based on a user-defined material.

                       and (b) VTASC model.



        Two ambient nodes are used to model the hot and cold walls, and their interaction with the
rod is modeled using two solid-ambient conductors. Because GFSSP is first and foremost a fluid
analysis code, it is necessary to include a fluid flow path in any GFSSP model that is being developed.
Therefore, a dummy flow circuit consisting of two boundary nodes, two internal nodes, and three
pipe flow branches was used to represent the ambient environment of figure 160. The details of the
flow path were arbitrarily chosen with the sole intent of maintaining a constant temperature of 70 °F
at all points in the flow path to correctly simulate the ambient environment. The two internal flow
nodes are connected to the solid rod by eight solid-fluid conductors that represent the heat transfer
between the ambient and the rod in figure 160. Figure 161(b) shows how this model looks in VTASC.

                            6.14 Example 14—Chilldown of a Cryogenic Pipe Line

6.14.1 Problem Considered

        For this example, the chilldown of a cryogenic pipe line to validate GFSSP’s transient conju-
gate heat transfer capability has been selected. In the 1960s, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)
conducted a series of chilldown experiments on a cryogenic transfer line.49 The test set-up (fig. 163)
is a vacuum-jacketed, 200-ft-long copper pipe of 5/8-in inner diameter. A pressurized 80-gal dewar
feeds liquid hydrogen into the pipe that is initially at ambient temperature. The wall temperature is
measured at four thermocouple stations at distances of 20, 80, 141, and 198 feet from the inlet. When
the fluid touches the relatively warm pipe walls, heat transfer causes the liquid cryogen to boil and the
pipe wall temperature to decrease. Eventually the pipe chills down to the liquid temperature, and the
liquid front gradually travels further down the pipe line. At the outlet of the pipe line, vapor exits to
the atmosphere.

       The NBS experiments were conducted with liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen at various
driving pressures with saturated and subcooled fluid. This example problem models one of the tests
with an inlet boundary of saturated LH2 at 74.97 psia and –411 °F.

6.14.2 GFSSP Model

        Figure 164 shows the GFSSP model of the chilldown experiment. The pipe line has been
discretized into 30 pipe branches, each 80 in long. The fluid nodes are connected to 31 solid nodes
representing the mass of the copper pipe. The fluid and solid nodes are initially at the ambient tem-
perature of 44 °F. Boundary node 1 represents the storage dewar at 74.97 psia and –411 °F. Bound-
ary node 33 is the ambient atmosphere in Boulder, Colorado, at 12.05 psia. Restriction 12 represents
the inlet valve, which opens during the first 0.05 s of the simulation. Restriction 3233 represents the
minor loss of the pipe line exit, with a K factor of 1.

       The solid nodes are connected to the fluid nodes by fluid to solid conductors, which model
convection from the fluid to the pipe wall. The built-in Miropolskii correlation is used to calculate
the convection coefficient for the two-phase flow. Because the pipe is vacuum-jacketed, heat transfer
between the pipe walls and the ambient is assumed negligible.

6.14.3 Results

        Figure 165 shows GFSSP’s predicted solid temperatures at each of the four stations as func-
tions of time. These compare well to the measured temperatures. At this driving pressure, the pipe
line chills down in about 70 s.

         Figure 166 shows GFSSP’s predicted flow rate at the entrance and mid section of the pipe
line. It is noted that the flow rate at the entrance is initially very unstable. This is caused by rapid boil-
off of the cryogen, leading to pressure spikes that temporarily reverse the flow rate. Such behavior
was also observed during the NBS experiments. The pressure spikes during startup are seen in figure
167, plotting the pressure near the entrance and mid section of the pipe.

        Figure 168 shows the predicted quality (vapor mass fraction) at the nodes corresponding to the
four experimental measurement stations. The flow is initially all vapor, but then transitions to a satu-
rated liquid-vapor mixture, and eventually becomes pure liquid flow at the upstream stations shortly
after their pipe section has completely chilled down. Cross et al.33 have generated an analytical solu-
tion to the chilldown problem by assuming constant properties and a constant convection coefficient.
Figure 169 shows how a modified version of GFSSP’s example 14 compares to the analytical solution.

       Example 14 input and output files including history and property files are in appendix U.

                             6.15 Example 15—Simulation of Fluid Transient Following Sudden Valve Closure

6.15.1 Problem Considered

        This example takes advantage of GFSSP’s capability to model fluid transients. Fluid tran-
sients, also known as water hammer, can have a significant impact on the design and operation of
both spacecraft and launch vehicle propulsion systems. These transients often occur at system acti-
vation and shutdown, and they must be predicted accurately to ensure the structural integrity of the
propulsion system fluid network.

       Consider the system shown in figure 170. LOX at 500 psia and 200 °R flows through a 400-ft-
long, 0.25-in inside diameter pipe line at a mass flow rate of 0.1 lbm/s. The corresponding down-
stream pressure is 450 psia. At time zero, a valve at the end of the pipe begins a 100-ms rapid closure.
This example discusses how to predict the liquid’s response to the sudden valve closure, including the
maximum expected surge pressure in the line.

6.15.2 GFSSP Model

        The GFSSP model of the propellant tank and pipe line schematic of figure 170 is shown in fig-
ure 171. The system is represented by seven nodes and six branches. Node 1 represents the propellant
tank as a boundary node. Node 7 represents the downstream pressure as a boundary node. Nodes
2 to 6 are internal nodes where pressure, temperature, and density are calculated. Branches 12 to 56
represent pipe segments with an 80-ft length and 0.25-in diameter. Branch 67 represents the valve as
a flow through a restriction with a flow area of 0.0491 in2 and a flow coefficient of 0.6. In addition,
GFSSP’s unsteady valve open/close option is used to model the rapid valve closure in branch 67. The
Valve Open/Close characteristics are defined in the Valve Open/Close dialog shown in figure 172. The
Valve Open/Close characteristic file is also shown below with annotations to explain the meanings
of each value. GFSSP’s restart option is used to set the initial conditions of the model. The model is
run as a steady state model, and the solution is saved in files FNDEX15.DAT and FBREX15.DAT.
This solution is then read in as the initial solution for the transient model run.

        Some consideration should be given to the time step for this model. In order to properly
model the fluid transient, a time step must be chosen that is small enough to accommodate the model
discretization. This is done by calculating the Courant number, which is the period of oscillation of
one branch divided by the time step (eq. (105)). For the model to properly capture the fluid transient
phenomena, the Courant number should be greater than unity:

                                                     4L branch
                                Courant Number =                 ≥1 .                           (105)

The speed of sound (afluid) for LOX is 2,462 ft/s. Choosing a time step of 0.02 s gives a Courant
number of 6.5, which satisfies the criteria for this model.

6.15.3 Results

       The input and output files including history and restart files of example 15 have been
attached in appendix V. Figure 173 compares GFSSP’s predicted pressure at node 6 with a method
of charac-teristics (MOC) solution. Both solutions compare very well in the timing and character
of the pre-dicted pressure oscillations. The maximum surge pressure predicted by GFSSP is 624
psia compared to a MOC prediction of 636 psia. Additional studies have been performed using
varying levels of discretization, different fluids, and even liquid-gas mixtures.37 A sudden valve
opening situation has been modeled and compared with test data.53

      6.16 Example 16—Simulation of a Pressure Regulator Downstream of a Pressurized Tank

6.16.1 Problem Considered

        This example repeats the blowdown problem of example 8, but simulates the operation of
a pressure regulator downstream of the pressurized tank. Consider a tank (fig. 174) with an internal
volume of 10 ft3, containing air initially at a pressure and temperature of 100 psia and 80 ºF, respec-
tively. Air passes through a pressure regulator and is then discharged into the atmosphere through an
orifice of 0.1-in diameter for a period of 150 s. GFSSP is used to determine the mass flow rate and
pressure/temperature history of the tank contents during blowdown. The detailed GFSSP model
schematic is shown in figure 175 while the VTASC model is shown in figure 176.

6.16.2 GFSSP Model

       The process is modeled with three nodes and two branches. Node 1 is an internal node that
represents the tank volume, with initial pressure of 100 psia and initial temperature of 80 °F. Node 2
represents the small volume between the regulator and the outlet orifice. Node 3 represents the ambi-
ent boundary with constant pressure of 14.7 psia. The history file, ex16hs3.dat, is the same as the
history file used for example 8. Resistance option 2 (Restriction) was used for branches 12 and 23.
Branch 12 represents the pressure regulator with an initial flow area of 0.04 in2. Branch 23 is the
outlet orifice with a flow area of 0.00785 in2.

       The pressure regulator option is activated on the Unsteady Options page, and the dialog box
is found on the Advanced menu. The option should be applied to Restriction or Compressible Orifice
branches. There are two options for modeling a pressure regulator:

• Option 1 is an iterative algorithm that continuously adjusts the flow area of the branch in each
  time step, not leaving the time step until the desired downstream pressure is achieved (within the
  user-specified tolerance level), or until the maximum number of iterations is reached. Only one
  regulator per model is allowed. This option acts like a regulator that reacts instantly to changes in
  the flow network. Because it can take many iterations to find the proper area to achieve the desired
  pressure in each time step, this option may run slowly.

• Option 2 is a time-marching algorithm in which the regulator area is adjusted just once at the
  beginning of each time step, based on an empirical correlation that compares the downstream
  pressure from the previous time step to the desired pressure.38 The pressure may oscillate about the
  setpoint for several time steps until convergence is reached. Multiple regulators are allowed with
  this option. As it takes a finite amount of time to reach the desired pressure, this option can more
  realistically model the behavior of a real pressure regulator. The time to achieve convergence can
  be adjusted by modifying the initial regulator area and the relaxation parameter. Because the flow
  area is corrected just once per time step, this option will generally run more quickly than option 1.

       The pressure regulator history file for branch 12 is shown in table 31. It calls for a downstream
pressure of 35 psia for the first 10 s, followed by 40 psia thereafter. The user can also set a constant
pressure in the dialog box. Air is modeled using the ideal gas option.

about the desired pressure when option 2 is used, and how option 1 reacts instantly to the change

       6.17 Example 17—Simulation of a Flow Regulator Downstream of a Pressurized Tank

6.17.1 Problem Considered

        This example repeats the blowdown problem of example 8, but simulates the operation of a flow
regulator downstream of the pressurized tank. Consider a tank (fig. 182) with an internal volume of
10 ft3, containing air initially at a pressure and temperature of 100 psia and 80 ºF, respectively. Air
passes through a flow regulator and is then discharged into the atmosphere for a period of 20 s. GFSSP
is used to determine the pressure/temperature history of the tank contents during blowdown. The
detailed GFSSP model schematic is shown in figure 183 while the VTASC model is shown in figure 184.

6.17.2 GFSSP Model

        The process is modeled with two nodes and one branch. Node 1 is an internal node that rep-
resents the tank volume, with initial pressure of 100 psia and initial temperature of 80 °F. Node 2
represents the ambient boundary with a constant pressure of 14.7 psia. The history file, ex17hs3.dat, is
the same as the history file used for example 8. Branch 12 represents the flow regulator, modeled with
resistance option 22 (Compressible Orifice).

      The flow regulator option is activated on the Unsteady Options page, and the dialog box is
found on the Advanced menu. The option should be applied to Restriction or Compressible Orifice
branches. There are two options for modeling a flow regulator:

• Option 1 is an iterative algorithm that continuously adjusts the flow area of the branch in
  each time step, not leaving the time step until the desired flow rate is achieved (within the user-
  specified tolerance level), or until the maximum number of iterations (currently hard-coded to 50)
  is reached. Only one regulator per model is allowed. This option acts like a regulator that reacts
  instantly to changes in the flow network. Because it can take many iterations to find the proper area
  to achieve the desired flow rate in each time step, this option may run slowly.

• Option 2 is a time-marching algorithm in which the regulator area is adjusted just once at the begin-
  ning of each time step, based on the numerical derivative of the change in flow rate with respect to
  the change in flow area, calculated from the results of the previous time steps. The flow rate may
  oscillate about the setpoint for several time steps until convergence is reached. Because other ele-
  ments of the model may also affect the flow rate derivative, this option can be numerically unstable;
  under-relaxation may be required. Multiple regulators are allowed with this option. As it takes
  a finite amount of time to reach the desired flow rate, this option can more realistically model the
  behavior of a real flow regulator. The time to achieve convergence can be adjusted by modifying the
  initial regulator area and the relaxation parameter. Because the flow area is corrected just once per
  time step, this option will generally run more quickly than option 1.
                                                                                                   233
  List of Tables



        The flow regulator history file is shown in table 32. It calls for a flow rate 0.012 lb/s for the first
10 s, followed by 0.020 lb/s thereafter. The user can also set a constant flow rate in the dialog box. Air
is modeled using the ideal gas option.

6.17.3 Results

       The input and output files of this example are included in appendix X as ex17.dat
and ex17.out. The transient test model was run for 20 s with 0.5-s time step, using both flow
regulator options. Calculated tank pressure and temperature, flow regulator area, and flow rate
are shown in figures 185–188. Note that option 2 takes several time steps to reach the target
flow rate, while option 1 reacts instantly to the change in required flow rate at 10 s.

simulate subsonic Fanno flow. Fanno flow is the flow with friction in an adiabatic constant-area pipe.
Consider a supply line (fig. 189) containing nitrogen gas at a pressure and temperature of 50 psia and
80 ºF, respectively. Nitrogen gas is discharged into a pipe of 3,207 in length and 6 in diameter. GFSSP
will be used to determine the pressure, mass flow rate, and temperature history through pipes using
the Fanno flow process. These predicted values are then compared with the analytical solution.

        The process has been modeled with 21 nodes and 20 branches. Node 1 is a boundary node
that represents the supply line. For the steady state Fanno flow formulation, the node initial guess
must be supplied for each internal node and conditions must be supplied for each boundary node.
The initial pressure and temperature for boundary nodes 1 and 21 are shown in table 33. Resistance
option 1 (pipe) was used for all branches with different lengths, as shown in table 34. For all pipes,
the diameter is 6 in, and the absolute roughness is set to zero in VTASC. Inertia was activated in all
branches to account for fluid acceleration caused by density change. Nitrogen gas is modeled using
the general fluid option that is available in VTASC. Table 35 shows the steady state results of pres-
sure, temperature, and density in internal nodes.

        This example validates GFSSP’s prediction with the analytical solution. The analytical solu-
tion, discussed below, is valid for flows with heat transfer and friction. However, the friction factor
must be constant throughout the length of the pipe. On the other hand, GFSSP calculates the fric-
tion factor with local properties such as density, viscosity, and velocity, and friction factor varies
from branch to branch. Therefore, in order to obtain a GFSSP solution with constant friction factor,
this model makes use of User Subroutine to set a constant friction factor in all branches. Subroutine
KFADJUST was used to adjust Kf for a given friction factor. The analytical solution assumes a fric-
tion factor of 0.002. The listing of Subroutine KFADJUST in appendix Y shows how to implement
the constant friction factor in GFSSP.

dT0 /dx in equation (108) can be determined from the energy equation which can be expressed as:

                                        q(π D)dx = 

       Given the inlet conditions (eq. (108)), the first order differential equation (eq. (108))
in M is solved to find the Mach number at any x location. As this equation is a nonlinear equation in
M, this equation is solved by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method.27

       From Mach number, the static temperature and pressure can be determined from the follow-
ing equations:

        No heat transfer implies the stagnation temperature is constant and dT0 /dx = 0. Before pre-
senting the results for Fanno flow, choice of pipe length as 3,207 in is explained below. From the ana-
lytical solution for Fanno flow, the critical length of the pipe (L*) is determined from the following
equation:

                                    fL * 1− M 2 1+ γ ⎛ (1+ γ )M 2 ⎞
                                        =      +    ln                   .                                (112)
                                     D    γM2    2y ⎜⎝ 2 + (γ − 1)M 2 ⎟⎠

        M is the inlet Mach number. The critical length of the pipe is the length required for the flow
to choke at the exit (i.e., M = 1 at exit). With an inlet Mach number of 0.5 and a friction factor of
0.002, and pipe diameter of 6 in, the critical length is calculated to be 3,207 in. This length is kept
fixed for the cases of constant area pipes.

6.18.3 Results

        Figure 192 shows a plot of the p/p* ratio with different types of node distribution for the
numerical solution compared with the analytical solution. A nonuniform node distribution with
a total of 21 nodes (20 control volumes) is sufficient to get a grid-independent solution. The cor-
responding temperature distribution is shown in figure 193. The plots also show that the numerical
solution using GFSSP agrees very well with that of the analytical solution.

       Figure 194 shows a plot of the Mach number along the axial direction, and again the agree-
ment with the analytical solution is quite good. The slight difference even at the inlet is because,
in GFSSP, the mass flow rate is not prescribed, rather the pressure boundary condition is specified,
and the flow rate is computed.

6.19.1 Problem Considered

        This example illustrates the capabilities of the steady state flow formulation of GFSSP to
simulate subsonic Rayleigh flow. Rayleigh flow is the frictionless flow in a constant area pipe with
heat transfer. Consider a supply line (fig. 195) containing nitrogen gas at a pressure and temperature
of 50 psia and 80 ºF, respectively. Nitrogen gas is flowing with an inlet Mach number of 0.5 through
a pipe that is 3,207 in long and has a 6 in diameter. A heat input rate of 1,800 Btu/s has been applied
along the length of the discharge pipe. GFSSP will be used to determine the pressure, mass flow
rate, and temperature history through pipes using the Rayleigh flow process. These predicted values
are then compared with the analytical solution. The detailed model schematic is shown in figure 196
while the VTASC model is shown in figure 197.

6.19.2 GFSSP Model

        The GFSSP model schematic is shown in figure 196 and the VTASC model is shown in fig-
ure 197. The process has been modeled with 21 nodes and 20 branches. Node 1 is a boundary node
that represents the supply line. For the steady state Rayleigh flow formulation, the node heat rate
and the initial guess must be supplied for each internal node and conditions must be supplied for
each boundary node. The initial pressure and temperature for boundary nodes 1 and 21 are shown
in table 36. The initial guess pressure, temperature, and heat rate for internal nodes 2 through 20 are
shown in table 37. Resistance option 1 was used for all branches with different lengths, as shown
in table 38. However, to simulate frictionless flow the friction factor is set to zero in the User Sub-
routine. Inertia was activated in all branches to account for fluid acceleration caused due to density
change. Nitrogen gas is modeled using the general fluid option that is available in VTASC. Table 39
shows the steady state results of the internal node. For all pipes, the diameter is 6 in, and the absolute
roughness is set to zero.

6.19.3 Results

       The main objective of this example is to validate GFSSP’s prediction with the analytical
solution described in section 6.18 in the context of Fanno flow. Equation (108) is valid for both
heat transfer and friction. In order to obtain the solution for Rayleigh flow, friction factor in equa-
tion (108) is set to zero. Subroutine KFADJUST was used to set the zero friction factor (app. Z).

        Figures 198 and 199 show the distribution of temperature and Mach number for a heat input
rate of 1,800 Btu/s on the same pipe geometry that has been used for Fanno flow (example 18). The
inlet Mach number is chosen as 0.5 and it has been analytically calculated that with this inlet Mach
number, a heat input of 1,800 Btu/s makes the flow choked at the exit (i.e., Mach number = 1). Fur-
ther increase in the heat rate will make the flow supersonic and in the present work, only subsonic
flow is being considered.27 Again, the numerical results show quite good agreement (within 5%) with
the analytical solution.

            6.20 Example 20—Modeling of Closed Cycle Liquid Metal (Lithium) Loop
                          With Heat Exchanger to Heat Helium Gas

6.20.1 Problem Considered

        A lithium loop with a counter flow heat exchanger system configuration, as shown in fig-
ure  200, was chosen for this example. The specific objective of the lithium circuit analysis using
GFSSP was to model a closed loop with heat addition and rejection typical for a thermodynamic
cycle. The model includes the pump, reactor core, heat exchanger with liquid lithium and nitro-
gen gas. This example also employs cyclic boundary to model a closed cycle, and illustrates the use
of user-defined fluid by providing property tables because lithium properties are not available in
GFSSP’s thermodynamic property package. The model calculates the pressure and temperature of
the fluid in each component during steady state operation.

    List of Figures



        As shown in figure 201, counter flow heat exchange occurs when the hot branch of the heat
exchanger has a flow that is propagating in a direction opposite of the cold branch. This counter flow
heat exchanger configuration consists of liquid lithium, at 7 psi and 932 °F, flowing through a 46.56-in
concentric annulus duct of 2.8-in inner radius and 5-in outer radius pipe. Also, from the cold side of
the heat exchanger, nitrogen is flowing at 200 psi and 477 °F through a 13-in section of 3.26-in inner
diameter pipe, through the heat exchanger, and out through compressible orifice of area of 0.13 in2
and flow coefficient of 1 at 14.7 psi and 60 °F. All of the initial guess values for this problem are shown
in figure 201. The style-IV pump performance is shown in figure 202, which was modeled in a User
Subroutine. The lithium properties were introduced through look-up property tables.

       The GFSSP analysis provides numerical predictions of pressure and temperature at various
locations in the flow circuit.

6.20.2 GFSSP Model

       A GFSSP model consisting of 28 nodes and 27 branches is used to represent the NaK test
loop and counter flow heat exchanger system shown in figure 201. Nodes 1, 30, and 35 are boundary
nodes. Node 1 is a cyclic boundary node at 7.02 psi and 932 °F. This implies that the temperature at
node 22 must be equal to the temperature at node 1 and this must be achieved by iteration. Node 30
represents the inlet boundary node at 200 psi and 477 °F for the nitrogen cold flow of Heat Exchanger.
Option 2 (Flow Through Restriction) was used for branch 1718 in place of the pump because the
flow rate versus developed pressure curve has multiple curves depending on voltage, and therefore
must be modeled as a momentum source in a User Subroutine. Branches 1314 and 3233 represent
the hot and cold sides, respectively, of the heat exchanger. Figure 203 shows how this model appears
in VTASC. GFSSP output results are shown in figure 204.

                         6.21 Example 21—Internal Flow in a Turbopump

6.21.1 Problem Considered

        It is desired to calculate the axial thrust of the SIMPLEX turbopump operating at
25,000 rpm with LOX as the operating fluid.29 In order to calculate axial thrust, the pressure dis-
tribution throughout the secondary flow system of the turbopump must be obtained. Figure 206
shows a schematic of the turbopump. The pressure is known at the inducer inlet, the inducer dis-
charge, on the back face of the impeller (upstream of the Labyrinth seal), on the front face of the
impeller shroud (upstream of the Labyrinth seal), at the end of the atmospheric dump lines (two
dump lines), and on the front and back face of the turbine. The pressure at the exit of the impeller
is not known, due to flow conditions at the pressure tap corresponding to the impeller discharge.
(The value of the pressure at the impeller discharge must be estimated.) The values of pressure
and temperature at these positions are listed in table 40, and are boundary conditions for the GFSSP
model. Axial thrust and pressures throughout the internal flow circuit are to be calculated using
GFSSP.

6.21.2 GFSSP Model

      Figure 206 indicates the flow passages that will be modeled using GFSSP. The modeled
passages are numbered, with each number corresponding to the passage as follows:

        (1) Axial flow between the impeller shroud and the housing flowing from the impeller
            discharge.
        (2) Radially inward flow between the impeller shroud and the housing.
        (3) Flow through the labyrinth seal at the end of the impeller shroud.
        (4) Radially inward flow between the end of the impeller shroud and the housing flowing

       (13) Flow through two external return lines.
       (14) Flow through eight radially inward holes flowing into inducer inlet.
       (15) Flow through the first turbine-end labyrinth seal.
       (16) Flow through 22 radially outward holes (for dump lines).

   List of Figures



        The detailed model of the secondary flow passages for this turbopump is shown schemati-
cally in figure 207, and the VTASC model is shown in figure 208. Heat is added to nodes 110 and 112
to account for the heat transferred from the bearings. Heat is also added to node 109 to match the
temperature at that node with the experimental data. As seen in figure 207, branches 2401 through
2408 and 2131 through 2138 were originally modeled as eight separate but identical pipe branches;
branches 2801 through 2822 were originally 22 separate branches. In the current VTASC model seen
in figure 208, these are now modeled using the Parallel Tube branch option (option 21). Because the
Parallel Tube option does not include entrance and exit loss K-factors, branches 2132 and 2802 were
added with equivalent lengths to produce an identical Kf.

          6.22 Example 22—Simulation of a Fluid Network With Fixed Flow Rate Option

6.22.1 Problem Considered

        Sometimes the boundary condition of a fluid network is given as a flow rate instead of
a boundary pressure. Besides using an estimated boundary pressure and a flow regulator branch, the
user could also attach a Fixed Flow branch (option 24) to a boundary node. GFSSP is always solv-
ing the conservation equations for flow rate, so the Fixed Flow branch does not set the desired flow
rate, per se. Instead, it uses a nearly vertical pump curve to trick the code into solving for the branch
pressure rise necessary to achieve the required flow rate (see sec. 3.1.7.24).

6.22.2 GFSSP Model

       Figure 211 shows the VTASC canvas of a model with two Fixed Flow branches. Note that
Fixed Flow branches must be attached to a boundary node. Water passes from node 2 through a gate
valve and a 1,500-ft-long pipe to the exit boundary (node 4) at 14.7 psia. Pressures in boundary
nodes 1 and 5 are arbitrarily set to 14.7 psia, and the boundary temperature is 60 °F.

             Figure 211. VTASC model of a fluid network with fixed flow rate option.


        Both steady state and transient cases are modeled. In the steady state case, the required flow
rates in branches 12 and 52 are 100 and –10 lb/s, respectively. Note that a negative flow rate can be
handled to use a Fixed Flow branch as an exit branch.




                                                                                                     259

         In the transient case, history files are used to set the required flow rates. Table 41 is the history
file for branch 12. In the first 10 s, the required flow decreases from 100 to 50 lb/s, after which the flow
rate remains constant.

at 10 lb/s, after which flow enters the network at 10 lb/s.

6.22.3 Results

        The steady state input and output files of this example are included in appendix CC as
ex22ss.dat and ex22ss.out. In the steady state case, the required 100 lb/s flows into the network
via branch 12, while 10 lb/s flows out branch 52. The remaining 90 lb/s exits at branch 34,
satisfying conservation of mass. It is recommended that the user always verify that the program has
converged on the required flow rates; if it does not succeed, rerunning with a tighter convergence
criteria will usually solve the problem.

       The transient input and output files of this example are included in appendix DD
as ex22tr.dat and ex22tr.out. Note that although the program ran with the default conver-
gence criteria of 1 × 10–4, a plot of the sum of the inlet and outlet flow rates showed that con-
servation of mass was not achieved in every time step. This was remedied by tightening
the convergence criteria to 1 × 10–5 and increasing the maximum number of iterations to 2,000.

        Figure 212 is a plot of the flow rates in Fixed Flow branches 12 and 52, showing that they meet
their target flow rates set by the history files. Figure 213 compares the sum of the flow rates in branches
12 and 52 with the flow rate in branch 34 to demonstrate that mass is being conserved in the system.

       6.23 Example 23—Helium-Assisted, Buoyancy-Driven Flow in a Vertical Pipe Carrying
                          Liquid Oxygen With Ambient Heat Leak

6.23.1 Problem Considered

         This example models a vertical pipe carrying LOX, as might be the case with a propellant
recirculation line. To drive the flow without the aid of a pump, one can use buoyancy effects from
heat transfer and/or helium injection. This example includes three GFSSP models in three VTASC
files: a steady state model of a recirculation line, a steady state model of a helium injector, and a tran-
sient model of a recirculation line with helium injection. The third model demonstrates the use of the
VTASC’s file import feature to combine the first two models. It is also an example of one of GFSSP’s
mixture options: separate energy conservation equations for separate species.

6.23.2 GFSSP Model

        Figure 214 shows the VTASC canvas of the Recirculation Line model. LOX at 55.78 psia and
–272.5 °F flows from boundary node 1 up to boundary node 8 at 53 psia. The pressure differential
of 2.78 psid represents the gravitational head of 6 ft of LOX, so that in the absence of heat transfer,
the fluid will remain stagnant. This can be confirmed by running the model with Conjugate Heat
Transfer deactivated; GFSSP will predict a flow rate near zero. The recirculation line is 6 ft long with
a diameter of 1.87 in. It is discretized into six pipe branches. Five of the 6 ft are assumed to be well
insulated, but 1 ft is left uninsulated, to allow heat transfer from the ambient. Solid nodes 9 and 10
represent the mass of the Inconel 718 pipe, separated by a conductor of 0.225-in thickness. There is
convection from the outside wall of the pipe to a 70 °F ambient temperature with an assumed con-
vection coefficient of 2 Btu/hr-ft2-°F. There is also convection between the inside wall and the LOX,
with the convection coefficient calculated by GFSSP using the Dittus-Boelter correlation.

       Figure 215 shows the VTASC canvas of the Helium Injector model. Helium at 425 psia and
100 °F flows from boundary node 1 to boundary node 4 at 14.7 psia. The injector line is broken
into two pipes of 0.152 in diameter. The pipes are connected by a small orifice with an area of
0.0012566 in2, corresponding to a diameter of 0.04 in.

       Helium Injector branch 34 has been connected to LOX Recirculation Line node 103, and
boundary node 4 has been deleted. This allows the helium to bubble into the LOX line just below
node 104, where heat transfers into the fluid. The problem is changed from steady to unsteady, with
a run of 100 s at 0.1 s intervals.

        Because there are two fluids, oxygen and helium, the Mixture option is enabled on the Circuit
Options page. The Mixture option is changed from the default temperature solution of the energy
equation (see eq. (16)) to option Enthalpy 2: Separate Energy Equations for Separate Species (see
sec. 3.1.3.2). This is the only mixture option capable of handling phase change and is required to
model the oxygen vapor that forms in the flow.

6.23.3 Results

        The LOX recirculation line steady state model files are included in appendix EE as ex23A.dat
and ex23A.out. GFSSP predicts that the heat transfer drives a flow of 0.172 lb/s in the vertical pipe.
The temperature of the fluid rises from –272.5 to –271.3 °F, while its density decreases from 66.7 to
63.3 lb/ft3. Part of the density decrease is caused by formation of oxygen vapor, indicated by the exit-
ing fluid having a quality of 0.0014. The conjugate heat transfer calculations indicate a heat rate into
the fluid of 0.106 Btu/s. The Dittus-Boelter correlation predicts the internal convection coefficient
to be 33.3 Btu/hr-ft2-°F. The solution of the Solid Energy Conservation equation gives an inner wall
temperature of –248 °F.

      An interesting exercise is to evaluate how efficient the heat transfer is at driving the fluid flow.
The work required to achieve the predicted flow rate is:

                          !          "       lb % "     lb f ( ft %                  s
                                     $# 66.4 3 '& $# 778 Btu '&
                                            ft


Since 0.106 Btu/s of heat leak are driving this flow, the efficiency of the process is just 1.26%.

      The helium injector steady state model files are included as ex23B.dat and ex23B.out in
appendix FF. The predicted flow rate is 0.00163 lb/s.

        The files for the unsteady model that combine the recirculation line with the helium injector are
included as ex23C.dat and ex23C.out in appendix GG. Figure 217 is a plot of the flow rate of helium
in the injector (F12) and of the LOX-helium mixture in the recirculation line (F56). It is seen that
a small flow rate of 0.005 lb/s of helium, combined with the heat transfer into the uninsulated portion
of the line, increases the flow rate to a steady value of 1.80 lb/s. Initially the flow rate is even larger
because the pipe is chilling down from 70 °F, and heat transfer is greater.

                 6.24 Example 24—Simulation of Relief Valve in a Pressurized Tank

6.24.1 Problem Considered

       This example demonstrates the use of a pressure relief valve to allow flow out of a node that
has exceeded a defined pressure. This Advanced option is different from the Control Valve branch
option (option 18). The control valve monitors pressure in a node and opens to allow fluid to enter
the node when pressure gets too low. In contrast, the relief valve monitors pressure in a node and
opens to allow fluid to exit the node when pressure gets too high.

         Figure 220 shows a schematic of the system being modeled. Air at 35 psia and 70 °F flows
through a 0.316-in-diameter orifice and into a 10 ft3 tank, initially at 14.7 psia. A relief valve on top
of the tank has a cracking pressure of 9.5 psid above the ambient pressure of 14.7 psia. As the tank
fills with air, the relief valve will open whenever the tank pressure exceeds 24.2 psia.

        Table 43 shows the file that controls how far the relief valve opens as a function of the pres-
sure differential across the valve. If a Restriction or Compressible Orifice option is used as the relief
valve, then area in square inches is given as a function of pressure in psid. If a Valve with Cv Branch
option is used, then area is replaced with Cv values. The first point should be the reseating pressure,
which uses a very small area or Cv to represent a closed valve. The last point should be the pressure
at which the valve is opened to the maximum area.

Figure 222 is a plot of the pressure in the tank over time. Whenever the pressure exceeds the
cracking pressure of 9.5 psid (24.2 psia), the relief valve opens, allowing air to escape. When the
pressure falls below the reseat pressure of 7 psid (21.7 psia), the relief valve closes and the tank
begins to pressur-ize again.

             6.25 Example 25—Two-Dimensional Recirculating Flow in a Driven Cavity

6.25.1 Problem Considered

         In this example, two-dimensional recirculating flow in a square cavity60 has been modeled using
GFSSP’s multidimensional flow calculation capability. In a square cavity, the flow is induced by shear
interaction at the top wall as shown in figure 224. The length of each wall is 12 in. The density of the
fluid is assumed constant at 1 lbm/ft3, and the viscosity of the fluid is assumed to be 1 lbm/(ft.s). The
bottom and side walls are fixed. The top wall is moving to the right at a constant speed of 100 ft/s.
The corresponding Reynolds number for this situation is Re = 100.

6.25.2 GFSSP Model

        The GFSSP model of the driven cavity consists of 50 nodes (49 of which are internal) and
84 branches. For numerical stability, one boundary node with an arbitrary pressure of 14.7 psi was
introduced. A unit depth (1 in) was assumed for the required areas. It is assumed that the shear area for
each branch is 2 in2. The shear distance between adjacent branches is 1.71429 in and the shear distance
between walls and their adjacent branches is 0.85714 in. For transverse momentum, only adjacent
parallel branches were considered, and only connecting branches not associated with the boundary
node were used. The constant density option was used for the fluid, and the corresponding density and
viscosity used were 1 lbm/ft3 and 1 lbm/(ft.s), respectively. The bottom and side walls are fixed. The top
wall moves to the right at 100 ft/s. All parallel angles are 0°, and all transverse angles are 90°.

       The grid generation is performed in two steps: (1) Grid Generation is activated through
Advanced options and the system network is built with multidimensional elements as shown in fig-
ure 225 (a) and (b), and (2) the grid is then generated (fig. 225(b)) through a dialog box (sec. 5.4.10).

            6.26 Example 26—Fluid Transients in Pipes Due to Sudden Opening of Valve

6.26.1 Problem Description

         This example deals with water hammer in a pipe with entrapped air. This problem is different
from example 15 as the flow regulating valve is suddenly opened as compared to suddenly closing in
the case of example 15, and the results are validated against experimental data available in the litera-
ture.52 A 1.025-in-diameter long pipe is attached to a reservoir of water at one end and closed at the
other end with some entrapped air in the other end. A ball valve separates the water from the air as
shown in figure 229. The ball valve is closed until about 0.15 s, and then gradually opens to 100% at
about 0.4 s. This example has been set up according to the experimental study done by Lee et al.52
The two most important controlling parameters for this problem are the reservoir pressure (pR) and
the fractional air length present in the pipe as compared to the total pipe length (αg =Lg /LT ). The
initial length for the water volume in the pipe (Ll) is fixed to 20 ft, and initial length of air column
in the pipe (Lg) varies from a low of 1.23 ft to 16.23 ft, the value of α ranging from 0.0579 to 0.448,
respectively. The ratio of reservoir pressure to the initial pressure of the entrapped air (PR = pR/patm)
varies from 2 to 7, i.e., the reservoir pressure (pR) range being 29.4 to 102.9 psi. The objective of this
study is to predict the transient pressure at different points along the length of the pipe.

6.26.2 GFSSP Model

        The GFSSP model to represent the flow of water in the pipe is shown in figure 230. The 20-ft-
long pipe sector (only the water column) is divided into 10 uniform pipe segments and one restriction
separating 12 nodes. Boundary node 1 represents the tank (reservoir). A User Subroutine interfaces
node 12 to an unseen pseudo control volume containing air only. The pseudo control volume has
a fixed mass of air, but the volume changes as it is pressurized, owing to the fluctuation of pressure
at node 12. Thereby, the volume of node 12 changes as the volume of the imaginary control volume
changes. The volume change in node 12 is computed by a volume balance between the volume of
water and the volume of the entrapped air. The total volume (Vtot = Vair + V12) remains constant, and
must be equal to the initial total volume (since the pipe is closed at the other end). The equation of
state for water (for node 12) and entrapped air as given as follows:

For water:
                                                        (

For air:

       The volume of node 12 at any instant can be obtained by combining equations (114)–(117):

where Vair and V12 are the volume of entrapped air and volume of water in node 12.

       Along with the volume adjustment for node 12, there would be a momentum source added to
this node subject to air pressure from the entrapped air, and this is done through equation (119):

where u12 is the velocity at the last node, and V12 and V12* are the volume of the 12th node at the
current and previous time steps, respectively.

       The volume source for node 12 is implemented in the subroutine SORCEM in the User Sub-
routine through the variable VOLUME(IPN). The momentum source term given in equation (119) is
prescribed in subroutine SORCEF through the variable TERM100 for the last branch
(branch 1112). The User Subroutine for example 26 is in appendix JJ (ex26.for dat).

        The boundary condition at node 1 is provided through the history file ex26hs1.dat. The ball
valve opening control is provided through the area change of the control valve over time through the
data file, ex26vlv.txt.

6.26.3 Results

       For the numerical solution, a time step of 0.01 s has been used. The operating conditions are:
PR = 7 and αg = 0.45). The GFSSP input file (ex26.dat) and output file (ex26.out) are in appendix JJ.
Figure 231 compares GFSSP’s predicted pressure at node 12 with that of the experimental data points
of Lee and Martin. The predicted results compared very well, and even though the peak pressure
amplitude differs by about 7%, the frequencies of pressure oscillations matched very well.

       Fast Fourier Transform—A fast Fourier transform algorithm based on Danielson and
Lanczos54 has been used to transform the time domain pressure oscillations into the frequency
domain. The computer program FFT_Multiple.for has been generated based on this algorithm. The
time domain data are saved in a column format with time as independent variables in the first column
and multiple pressures (or some other variables in time domain) in successive columns; this file is
called p_t.txt, and the results are saved in a file called p_f.xls. For better accuracy, it is expected that
one uses N (number of data) as a power in 2, i.e. N = 2m, for any integer m. However, the present code
is capable of taking any number of input data, and computing the number of data to be used from
here, which is a power of 2.

                                   6.27 Example 27—Boiling Water Reactor

6.27.1 Problem Considered

       The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the phase change of water in a vertical tube
being heated from outside. This example also demonstrates the use of the Saturated Fluid Property
Table for modeling phase change. The results of the Fluid Property Table have been verified by
comparing them with the results obtained with WASP, GFSSP’s built-in thermodynamic property
program for water.

        Figure 233(a) shows the schematic of the problem considered. A 6-ft-long, 1-in-diameter ver-
tical water tube is being heated uniformly along the tube. The water enters the tube in a subcooled
state and exits as superheated vapor. The pressures at the inlet and outlet have been prescribed. The
model calculates flow rate through the tube, as well as the distribution of pressure, temperature, qual-
ity, and other thermophysical properties of water in the tube.

6.27.2 GFSSP Model

        The water tube has been discretized into ten equal segments resulting in ten branches, nine
internal nodes, and two boundary nodes where pressures were prescribed (fig. 233(b)). Steady-state
flow is assumed, and the flow rate is calculated by solving the momentum conservation equation
that accounts for the pressure difference between inlet and outlet boundaries, frictional resistance,
fluid inertia, and gravity. The external heat load was specified as 130 Btu/lbm in each of the nine
internal nodes. The calculated flow rate was 0.113 lbm/s. Therefore, the total applied heat load was
132.21 Btu/s or 140 kW. The water enters the reactor at a highly subcooled state (80 °F; saturation
temperature at 30 psia is 250.3 °F). The water leaves as superheated vapor at 354.4 °F (saturation
temperature in node 10 at 15.94 psia is 216.1 °F). In the GFSSP model, gravity and inertia were acti-
vated in all fluid branches. Inertia was activated due to the large change in velocity along the pipe.

        The GFSSP model was run with two different fluid options. First, the model was run with the
built-in GASP/WASP property package using water (ex27_with_WASP.vts). The same model was
then run with the User Fluid Property Table option (ex27_with_Property_Table.vts). In order to run
with the Property Table option, eight property tables are necessary. They are:

       (1) aakwater2.dat—Conductivity in Btu/s-ft-R
       (2) rhowater2.dat—Density in lbm/ft3
       (3) emuwater2.dat—Absolute viscosity in lbm/ft-s
       (4) gammawater2.dat—Specific heat ratio
       (5) hwater2.dat—Enthalpy in Btu/lbm
       (6) swater2.dat—Entropy in Btu/lbm-R
       (7) cpwater2.dat—Specific heat in Btu/lbm-R
       (8) satwater2.dat—Saturation table for pressure (psia), temperature (R), and enthalpy, density,
           specific heat, absolute viscosity, specific heat ratio, conductivity and entropy of liquid and vapor.




                                                                                                           281

that the saturation table is required when the Phase Change box is checked.

6.27.3 Results

       The input and output files for the boiling water reactor model run with the water property
tables are included in appendix KK as Ex27.Table.dat and Ex27.Table.out. The files for the same
model run with the WASP property package are included in appendix LL as Ex27.WASP.dat and
Ex27.WASP.out.

        Figure 235 shows the distribution of pressure and temperature along the length of the pipe. The
distribution of quality and density is shown in Figure 236. The distribution of velocity is shown in fig-
ure 237. The pressure drops continuously from inlet to outlet due to frictional and gravitational effects.
The temperature, however, first rises steadily until it reaches the saturation temperature. After reaching
the boiling temperature, the temperature slightly drops due to the drop in saturation temperature at
lower pressure. Once the water completely transforms to steam, temperature increases monotonically.
The quality increases continuously in the tube. The quality increases monotonically from zero to 1
(fig. 236); the variation of density is very significant due to phase change and is plotted in logarithmic
scale. The increase of velocity in figure 237 is another evidence of phase change as the mass flow rate is
the same at all sections of the tube, but the density decreases as water turns into vapor.

       6.27.3.1 Comparison of GFSSP Results With Hand Calculation. The outlet temperature can
be calculated by a simple energy balance for a control volume for a given mass flow rate. The energy
balance equation can be written as:

                                  (                    )

       From equation (120), Tout can be expressed as:

                                                   ⎡ Q

                                                        − Cp,liq Tsat − Tin − h fg ⎥ .         )          (121)

       From REFPROP, the saturation properties at an average pressure of 22.35 psia were evaluated:

        Tsat = 233.89 ºF; hfg = 956.69            ; Cp,liq = 1.0113         ; Cp,vap = 0.5103         .   (122)

       From equation (121), Tout = 346.92 ºF and GFSSP calculates T10 = 354.39 ºF.

        The 7.47º difference between hand calculation and GFSSP calculation can be attributed to the
use of average pressure and the assumption of constant specific heat in the hand calculation.

                       6.28 Example 28—No-Vent Tank Chill and Fill Model

6.28.1 Problem Considered

        The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the simulation of the no-vent chill and fill
method of chilling and filling a cryogenic tank. The practice of tank chilldown in microgravity envi-
ronment is quite different than tank chilldown on the ground. On the ground, under normal gravity,
a vent valve on top of the tank can be kept open to vent the vapor generated during the chilling pro-
cess. The tank pressure can be kept close to atmospheric pressure while the tank is chilling down. In
a microgravity environment, due to the absence of stratification, such practice may result in dumping
a large amount of precious propellant overboard. The intent of the no-vent chill and fill method is to
minimize the loss of propellant during chilldown of a propellant tank in a microgravity environment.
The no-vent chill and fill method consists of a repeated cyclic process of charge, hold, and vent.

        During the charge cycle, a small quantity of liquid cryogen is injected into the evacuated tank.
Some type of spray nozzle is usually used to break the incoming liquid into droplets. Initially, the
liquid flashes due to the low tank pressure, and then the remaining liquid droplets evaporate as they
contact warm hydrogen vapor or the tank wall. During the hold period, the circulating flow pattern
induced from the spray nozzles provides convective heat transfer from cold vapor to the tank wall.
The primary mode of heat transfer during the hold is convection. At the completion of the hold
period, the pressure has risen considerably and the tank is ready to be vented. Since venting occurs
as an isentropic blowdown, some additional cooling may be recovered by stage-wise venting. The key
parameters of this method are (1) charge magnitude, (2) spray system selection, (3) mass flow rate,
(4) hold duration, (5) acceleration environment, (6) desired tank wall temperature, and (7) maximum
operating pressure. A reliable and inexpensive mathematical model will help designers to perform
a large amount of calculations to optimize the key parameters. A GFSSP model was developed to
simulate chilldown of the LH2 tank at the K-site Test Facility56 and numerical predictions were com-
pared with test data.

       The test set-up at the K-site Test Facility, shown in figure 238, consists of a test tank, spray
system, test tank valves, instrumentation, and the vacuum chamber.

        The test tank selected was ellipsoidal with an 87-in major diameter and a 1.2 to 1 major to
minor axis ratio. The two ends are joined by a short 1.5-in cylindrical section. The tank is made of
2219 aluminum chemically milled to a nominal thickness of 0.087 in. Thicker sections exist where
they were required for manufacturing (mainly weld lands). The tank has a 28.35-in access flange on
the top. The tank weighs 329.25 lb, and the tank’s volume is 175 ft3. The tank was originally designed
for a maximum operating pressure of 80 psia. Prior to the start of testing the tank was requalified
by pneumatic test for a maximum operating pressure of 50 psia. The tank is covered with a blanket
of 34 layers of multilayer insulation (MLI) made with double aluminized Mylar and silk net spac-
ers, and is supported by 12 fiberglass epoxy struts. The test environment ambient temperature was
uniform and maintained at 530R ± 1R by an electrically heated shroud located outside the tank and
inside the vacuum chamber.

6.28.2 GFSSP Model

        A nine node tank (fig. 239) was built to simulate the test as described above. Boundary node 13
represents the supply tank which is supplying hydrogen at –420 ºF. The total flow rate was evenly dis-
tributed through branches 131 through 139. Figure 240 shows the transformation of the actual tank
configuration to the model configuration, where the tank geometry was assumed to consist of nine
volumes or ‘tank slices.’ The total volume and surface area of heat transfer between solid and fluid are
identical between the actual and model configurations. Nodes 1 through 9 represent the inside tank
volume where propellants reside, transfer from one control volume to another, exchange heat with
neighboring solid nodes, and change phases from liquid to vapor and vice versa. The mass and energy
conservation equations are solved in the nodes, connected by branches in which the momentum equa-
tion is solved. Node 12 is another boundary node that represents the tank outlet. Nodes 10 and 11,
branches 910, 1011, and 1112 represent the vent line. Nodes 1 through 9 are connected to metal solid
nodes 14 through 22 through fluid to solid conductors that allow convective heat transfer between solid
and fluid nodes. The model neglects axial conduction of heat.

  List of Tables



        Nodes 1 through 9 represent the volume of the test tank with initial pressure set to 1.97 psia
and initial temperature set to –19.57 ºF. The lengths and diameters of each branch that represent
the tank are given in table 45. Summing the individual tank slice volumes yields a total tank volume
of 301,836.93 in3. Branch 1112, modeled as a restriction, simulates the vent valve open and close.
Node 12 is a boundary node which represents the vent to ambient at pressure equal to 14.7 psia and
temperature equal to 60 ºF. Conductors 149, 158, 167, 176, 185, 194, 203, 212, and 221 represent the
heat transfer from the hydrogen fluid to the aluminum 2219 tank wall. The heat transfer area is the
surface area of each tank slice as given in table 46. Summing the individual heat transfer areas yields
a total model tank heat transfer area of 21,599.43 in2. The heat transfer coefficients were calculated
from a free convection correlation.57 Nodes 14 through 22 represent the tank material and mass
which are aluminum 2219 and the masses given in table 47. Summing the individual tank slice masses
yields a total model tank mass of 329.247 lb. The initial solid wall temperature was set to –19.57 ºF.

6.28.3 Results

      The input and output files for the no-vent chill and fill model are included in appendix MM
as Ex28.dat and Ex28.out. The user subroutine code is also included.

        Figure 241 shows the specified inlet flow rate and predicted pressure history. During the
charging period, the pressure increases rapidly due to evaporation. During the hold period, pressure
remains constant. During venting, pressure in the tank reduces rapidly. During the charging period,
the flow rate was assumed constant and was obtained from the reported test data. Figure 242 shows
the predicted mass history of hydrogen during the operation. There is very little hydrogen during the
chilling process because of venting.

       Figure 243 shows the predicted vent flow rate history during tank chilldown. Vent flow rate
reaches a peak value at the opening of the vent valve and diminishes as tank pressure reduces. Fig-
ure 244 shows vapor quality at all nine nodes during the process. As expected, liquid first forms at the
bottom node while the remaining nodes remain superheated. The sudden drop in the quality in the
bottom node is due to the blowdown effect. Predicted propellant loss agrees quite well with estimated
propellant loss during the test:

• Predicted—32.5 lb (nine node model) and 33.5 lb (one node model).
• Test—32 lb.

      6.29 Example 29—Self-Pressurization of a Cryogenic Propellant Tank Due to Boil-Off

6.29.1 Problem Considered

       The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the simulation of self-pressurization of an
LH2 tank performed under the Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) program.58 The purpose
of the MHTB program is to test a thermodynamic vent system (TVS) to reduce boil-off in a cryo-
genic propellant tank for long-term storage of propellant in space as shown in figure 245.

         The MHTB 5083 aluminum tank is cylindrical in shape with a height and diameter of 10 ft
and elliptic domes in both ends as shown in figure 246. It has an internal volume of 639 ft3 and sur-
face area of 379 ft2. Initially, the tank is allowed to self-pressurize due to boil-off and by not allow-
ing the vapor to vent. Once the pressure reaches the maximum allowable pressure, LH2 is introduced
into the tank through the spray bar. The pressure starts falling due to heat transfer, and when the
pressure reaches the minimum allowable pressure, the spray is stopped and the tank is allowed to
self-pressurize; thus, the TVS cycle continues. The purpose of the GFSSP model is to simulate the
initial self-pressurization when ullage pressure rises from the initial tank pressure to the upper bound
pressure when the spray starts. The GFSSP model results were then compared with the test data.
A 50% fill level case was modeled to simulate the self-pressurization test.

6.29.2 GFSSP Model

        Figure 247 shows the GFSSP model of self-pressurization in the MHTB tank at the 50% fill
level. Node 4 represents LH2; nodes 2, 8, 9, 10, and 11 represent the ullage at different fill levels. Node
3 is a pseudo boundary node separating LH2 from vapor hydrogen in the ullage space. Branches 45,
164, 162, 168, 169, 1610, and 1611 are for introducing LH2 into the tank through the TVS spray bar.
These branches are currently inactive during self-pressurization of the tank. Nodes 7, 6, 12, 13, 14,
and 15 are solid nodes representing the aluminum tank wall. Solid node 7 is connected with LH2
stored in fluid node 4. In this model, heat leak through insulation is calculated in the User Subroutine
and applied in the solid nodes as a source term.

       6.29.2.1 User Subroutine. In this model, a User Subroutine was used (1) to model evaporative
mass transfer at the liquid-vapor interface, (2) to calculate the heat transfer coefficient between the
wall and the fluid nodes, and (3) to calculate heat transfer through the MLI blankets.

       6.29.2.1.1 Evaporative Mass Transfer at Liquid-Vapor Interface. Figure 248 shows the
evaporative mass transfer process at the liquid-vapor interface. It is assumed that evaporation takes
place at the interface in a thin film which contains saturated vapor at ullage pressure.

      The input and output files for the MHTB self-pressurization model are included in
appendix NN as Ex29.dat and ex29.out. The user subroutine code is also included.

       Figure 251 shows the comparison between GFSSP predictions (in green and blue) and the
MHTB test data (in orange). GFSSP predictions of pressure are shown for a degradation factor of
1 and 2.8. The degradation factor is used to multiply equation (128) to represent the degradation of
performance of the MLI. It is observed that a degradation factor of 2.8 matches the test data well.

6.30.2 GFSSP Model
       The model consists of a propellant grain, orifice, and transition chamber followed by
a converging-diverging nozzle. The model requires development of a User Subroutine that calculates the
burn rate as a function of chamber pressure and estimates the change in the area as propellant burns.

       The purpose of the model is to calculate the pressure distribution, thrust, and area change
during the burning of solid propellant.

        The propellant burning rate (in/s) was expressed as follows:
                                                                           n
                                                                 r = aBR PC BR ,                                     (142)
where

        aBR = 0.0687
        nBR = 0.3
        Propellant density, rprop = 0.06 lbm/in3.

       The mass source in the chamber node (node 1) was calculated from the propellant burning
rate and propellant density in User Subroutine BNDUSER.

6.30.3 Results
      The input and output files for the solid propellant thruster model are included in
appendix OO as Ex30.dat and Ex30.out. The user subroutine code is also included.

        Figure 254 shows the pressure history in the chamber as well as at sections downstream of
the chamber. The rapid pressure rise during the start and tail-off after the completion of the burn is
predicted. Figure 255 shows the history of the burning rate (expressed as a mass source in lb/s) and
the flow rate at the nozzle exit. The cause of the pressure rise can be explained from this figure as the
mass source exceeds the flow through nozzle exit at the start. Figure 256 shows the history of area
change during propellant burn. Once the propellant grain radius reaches its maximum, there is no
further burning and area remains constant during the tail-off. Figure 257 shows the history of thrust
during propellant burn and tail-off.

       Highlights of this model’s control parameters that ensure stable numerical solution are as
follows:

• Very small time step (DTAU = 0.0001 s).
• Stringent convergence criterion (CC = 1e-07).
• Heavy under-relaxation on density (RELAXD = 0.05).
• During tail-off, RELAXNR was set to 0.3 in User Subroutine.

                    APPENDIX A—DERIVATION OF Kf FOR PIPE FLOW


       It is assumed that there is a dynamic equilibrium that exists between the friction and the pres-
sure forces. Therefore, the momentum conservation equation can be expressed as:

                                                             2
                                            P u − Pd = K f m ,                                  (143)

where Kf is a function of f, L, D, and ρ.

       For a fully developed pipe flow, the momentum conservation equation can be written as:

                                                                   π D2
                                     τ π DL = ( P u − P d )             .                        (144)
                                                                     4

       The Darcy friction factor (f) can be expressed as:

                                                     8 τ gc
                                               f =             .                                 (145)
                                                       ρ u2

       From the continuity equation,

                                                       4 m
                                              u=            .                                    (146)
                                                     ρ π D2

Substituting equations (116) and (117) into equation (115) gives:


                                                        8 f L m 2
                                       Pu − Pd =                    .                            (147)
                                                       g c ρ π 2 D5

Therefore,

                                                        8 fL
                                            Kf =                  .                              (148)
                                                     g c ρ π 2 D5




                                                                                                   311

           APPENDIX B—SUCCESSIVE SUBSTITUTION METHOD OF SOLVING
             COUPLED NONLINEAR SYSTEMS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS


       The application of the successive substitution method involves the following six steps:

       (1) Develop the governing equations:

                                                 (
                                          x1 = f1 x1,x2 ,x3 , …,xn   )
                                                 (
                                         x2 = f2 x1,x2 ,x3 , …,xn    )
                                                      …

                                                 (
                                        xn = fn x1,x2 ,x3 , …,xn .       )                                 (149)


If there are n number of unknown variables, there are n number of equations.

      (2) Guess a solution for the equations. Guess x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* as an initial solution for the
governing equations.


        (3) Compute new values of x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* by substituting x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* in the right-hand
side of equation (124).

      (4) Under-relax the computed new value, x = (1 – α)x* + αx, where α is the under-relaxation
parameter.


       (5) Replace x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* with the computed value of x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* from step (4).

       (6) Repeat steps (3)–(5) until convergence.

          APPENDIX C—NEWTON-RAPHSON METHOD OF SOLVING COUPLED
                NONLINEAR SYSTEMS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS


       The application of the Newton-Raphson Method involves the following seven steps:

       (1) Develop the governing equations. The equations are expressed in the following form:


                                                 (
                                            f1 x1,x2 ,x3 , …, xn = 0 )

                                                 (
                                            f2 x1,x2 ,x3 , …, xn = 0 )
                                                         …

                                             (                   )
                                          fn x1,x2 ,x3 , …, xn = 0 .
                                                                                            (150)


If there are n number of unknown variables, there are n number of equations.

        (2) Guess a solution for the equations. Guess x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* as an initial solution
for the governing equations.

       (3) Calculate the residuals of each equation. When the guessed solutions are substituted
into equation (120), the right-hand side of the equation is not zero. The nonzero value is the
residual:

                                                (                   )
                                            f1 x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* = R1



                                                (                   )
                                           f2 x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* = R2


                                                         …

                                            (                   )
                                          fn x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …,xn* = Rn .
                                                                                            (151)


The intent of the solution scheme is to correct x1* ,x2* ,x3* , …, xn* with a set of corrections
x1! , x2! , x3! , …, xn! such that R1,R2 ,R3 , …,Rn are zero.


                                                                                                 313
        (4) Develop a set of correction equations for all variables. First construct the matrix
of influence coefficients:

                                       ! f1   ! f1   ! f1   ! f1
                                                          …
                                       ! x1   ! x2   ! x3   ! xn
                                      ! f2    ! f2   ! f2   ! f2
                                                          …
                                      ! x1    ! x2   ! x3   ! xn
                                       …       …      …     …  …
                                      ! fn    ! fn   ! fn     ! fn .                      (152)
                                                            …
                                      ! x1    ! x2   ! x3     ! xn

Then construct the set of simultaneous equations for corrections:


                         ! !f
                               1   ! f1   ! f1   ! f1 $
                         #                     …       &
                         #  ! x    ! x2   ! x3   ! xn &
                               1                         ! x' $ ! R $
                         # !f                    ! f2 && #
                                                            1 &
                                   ! f2   ! f2                   # 1 &
                         #     2               …         # x ' & # R &
                         # ! x1    ! x2   ! x3   ! xn & # 2 & = # 2 & .                   (153)
                         #                             &       & #
                         # …        …      … … … & #                  &
                                                         # xn' & # Rn &
                         # ! fn    ! fn   ! fn   ! fn & "      % "    %
                         #                     …       &
                         #" ! x1   ! x2   ! x3   ! xn &
                                                       %


       (5) Solve for x1′ , x2′ , x3′ , …, xn′ by solving the simultaneous equations.

       (6) Apply correction to each variable.

       (7) Iterate until the corrections become very small.

while varying temperature:




                                                                                  353
Back to Appendix



        (5) Enter your first pressure and the temperature range and increment. Check the Leave
active and a Add to current table boxes to make it easier to assemble a table at multiple pressures.




       The example below shows water properties at three pressures and six temperatures (GFSSP’s
maximum is 301 pressures and 301 temperatures). Note carefully rows 5 and 6. At the given pressure
of 14.7 psia, water is saturated at 671.64 ºR (212 ºF), and so REFPROP has added these extra rows.
Examine your property data carefully for saturation properties.

      Highlight any lines of saturated data. Then select EDIT/DELETE ROWS.




      Your data should now look as below, with the same temperatures at each pressure.




                                                                                         355

     (6) Select FILE/SAVE TABLES. Uncheck the Include Column Headings and Include Row
Numbers boxes, and set the Full Width radio button.




      (7) Open the file you just saved with a text editor. Edit the file so that the first line gives the
number of pressures and number of temperatures. In this example there are three pressures and six
temperatures.

        (8) Copy the program ConvertRefprop.exe to your working directory (Windows will not
allow it to write output to the GFSSP installation directory.). Run the program and enter the REF-
PROP data filename. Choose English or SI units (choosing English units converts the units of ther-
mal conductivity from Btu/h-ft-ºF to Btu/s-ft-ºF). The program will produce the seven user-defined
fluid data files in your working directory.




       (9) Did you have to remove any lines of saturated data from the pressure/temperature range
of your data? Do you expect your fluid will change phase in your GFSSP model? If so, you must
also construct an eighth file of saturated properties. Instructions are given below, or consult the file
InstructionsToConvertREFPROP-DataToSaturatedFluidFile.pdf, also in the utilities folder

                                  F.2 Saturated Fuid Property Data

      This document provides instructions for converting SATURATED fluid property data from
the REFPROP program into GFSSP’s saturated user-defined fluid input file.

      (1) In REFPROP, select OPTIONS/UNITS. (Note that REFPROP English units set Ther-
mal Conductivity to Btu/h-ft-ºF; this will be converted to Btu/s-ft-ºF later.)




                                                                                                    357

      (2) Select OPTIONS/PROPERTIES and select Temperature, Pressure, Density, Enthalpy,
Entropy, Cp, Cp/Cv, Thermal Conductivity, and Viscosity:




                                                                                    359

      (3) Select SUBSTANCE/PURE FLUID and choose a fluid.




      (4) Select CALCULATE/SATURATION TABLES, then choose to vary Pressure:

      (5) Enter a pressure range and increment.




The example below shows saturated water properties at nine pressures.




     (6) Select FILE/SAVE TABLES. Uncheck the Include Column Headings and Include Row
Numbers boxes, and set the Full Width radio button.




                                                                                 361

     (7) Open the file you just saved with a text editor. Edit the file so that the first line gives the
number of saturation pressures. In this example there are nine pressures.




        (8) Copy the program ConvertRefpropSat.exe to your working directory (Windows will not
allow it to write output to the GFSSP installation directory). Run the program and enter the REF-
PROP data filename. Choose English or SI units (choosing English units converts the units of ther-
mal conductivity from Btu/h-ft-ºF to Btu/s-ft-ºF). The program will produce the saturated properties

Area remains close to zero until pressure is greater than
the cracking pressure (point 2). Then area is interpolated
from the curve. If pressure is greater than the max pressure
(point 3), then the valve is fully open at its maximum area.
If pressure falls below reseat pressure (point 1), then area
returns to nearly zero until pressure once again is greater
than the cracking pressure (point 2).

14. ABSTRACT
  The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a finite-volume based general-purpose computer program for analyz-
  ing steady state and time-dependant flow rates, pressures, temperatures, and concentrations in a complex flow network. The program
  is capable of modeling real fluids with phase changes, compressibility, mixture thermodynamics, conjugate heat transfer between solid
  and fluid, fluid transients, pumps, compressors and external body forces such as gravity and centrifugal. The thermofluid system to be
  analyzed is discretized into nodes, branches, and conductors. The scalar properties such as pressure, temperature, and concentrations are
  calculated at nodes. Mass flow rates and heat transfer rates are computed in branches and conductors. The graphical user interface allows
  users to build their models using the ‘point, drag, and click’ method; the users can also run their models and post-process the results in
  the same environment. The integrated fluid library supplies thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of 36 fluids, and 24 different
  resistance/source options are provided for modeling momentum sources or sinks in the branches. This Technical Publication illustrates
  the application and verification of the code through 30 demonstrated example problems.
